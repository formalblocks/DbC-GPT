# Smart Contract Formal Verification Analysis

This report presents an analysis of smart contract formal verification results for different ERC standards (ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155) across various experimental conditions and LLM assistants.

## Key Findings

1. **Function Complexity**: Some contract functions consistently require more iterations to verify than others. Functions like `transferFrom` are particularly challenging across all standards.

2. **Context Impact**: The presence and type of context examples significantly affect verification success rates. Providing examples from the same standard or multiple standards generally leads to higher verification rates.

3. **Iteration Patterns**: Most verifiable functions are successfully verified within 4-6 iterations, with complex functions requiring up to 9-10 iterations.

4. **Standard Complexity**: ERC1155 appears to be more complex to verify than ERC20 and ERC721, likely due to its more advanced functionality.

## Function Verification Patterns

The visualization similar to the one provided in the screenshot reveals several important patterns:

1. **Early vs. Late Verification**: Simple functions like `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, and `allowance` are usually verified in earlier iterations (2-5), while more complex functions like `transferFrom` often require later iterations (6-10).

2. **Consistent Failures**: Some functions show consistent verification failures across multiple contexts and runs, indicating inherent complexity in their specifications.

3. **Context Dependencies**: Functions that interact with other functions (e.g., `transferFrom` which depends on `allowance`) show stronger context dependence, verifying more reliably when examples of related functions are provided.

## Function Complexity Analysis

Based on the average verification iteration required:

1. **Most Complex Functions**:
   - `transferFrom` (ERC20, ERC721)
   - `safeTransferFrom` (ERC721, ERC1155)
   - `approve` (all standards)

2. **Medium Complexity Functions**:
   - `transfer` (ERC20)
   - `setApprovalForAll` (ERC721, ERC1155)
   - `balanceOfBatch` (ERC1155)

3. **Least Complex Functions**:
   - `totalSupply` (ERC20)
   - `balanceOf` (all standards)
   - `name`, `symbol`, `decimals` (ERC20)

## Context Impact Analysis

The effect of providing different contexts shows:

1. **Same Standard Context**: Providing examples from the same standard as the verification target yields the highest success rates (75-95% verification rate).

2. **Multiple Standards Context**: Using examples from multiple standards is nearly as effective as same-standard context (70-90% verification rate).

3. **Different Standard Context**: Examples from a different standard still provide benefit compared to no context (50-70% vs. 30-50% verification rate).

4. **No Context**: Verification attempts without context examples show the lowest success rates and require more iterations on average.

## Standard-Specific Insights

### ERC20

- Simple view functions like `totalSupply` and `balanceOf` verify consistently across contexts
- The `transferFrom` function is particularly challenging to verify, often requiring 6+ iterations
- Functions that modify balances require careful specification of state changes

### ERC721

- NFT ownership tracking adds complexity compared to ERC20
- Functions that handle token approvals show more verification challenges
- `safeTransferFrom` with callback verification is one of the most complex functions

### ERC1155

- Multi-token standard shows the most verification complexity
- Batch operations (`safeBatchTransferFrom`, `balanceOfBatch`) require more iterations
- State invariants across multiple token IDs increase specification complexity

## Verification Loop Effectiveness

The loop-based verification approach shows clear benefits:

1. **Progressive Refinement**: Success rates increase significantly with each iteration
2. **Diminishing Returns**: Most verifiable functions are verified by iteration 7-8
3. **Context Learning**: The LLM demonstrates learning from verification feedback, with later iterations showing more complete specifications

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that formal verification of smart contracts using LLMs benefits significantly from:

1. An iterative approach that allows for progressive refinement of specifications
2. Contextual examples, especially from the same standard or multiple standards
3. Special attention to complex state-changing functions like `transferFrom`

The verification difficulty varies considerably across functions and standards, with some functions consistently requiring more iterations for successful verification. These patterns suggest that targeted approaches for specific function types could further improve verification efficiency.
