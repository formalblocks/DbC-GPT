    Task: - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (/// @notice postcondition condition). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";"). - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior. - Replace $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance: /// @notice postcondition condition1
 /// @notice postcondition condition2
 function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;

    Requirements: - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values. - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables. - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable uint256 var can be referenced as var only. - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, function foo(uint256 bar, address par) has parameter names bar and par only. - Use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable) or __verifier_old_bool(stateVariable) to reference values from the start of the function execution. - A quantified postcondition MUST start with forall. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like /// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition. Without the forall at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid. - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array arr a postcondition quantification would look like /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid. - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form /// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2 is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form /// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2 is also invalid. You can use instead the notation !(condition) || condition2 to simulate the implication operator. For instance, /// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2 can be written as /// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2.

    Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


        ```solidity
        pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

        contract ERC123 {
            address public owner;
    address public trustedVerifier;
    address owner;
    address dataHash;
    bool verified;
    mapping(bytes32 => Identity) private identities;
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) private consents;

        **updateIdentity(bytes32 identityId, address newDataHash)**
- **Description**: Updates the hash of the data associated with an existing identity. This can be done by the owner or any caller who has been given consent. If the identity is verified and the hash is different, it should be reset.
- **Parameters**:
    - `identityId`: The unique identifier for the identity to be updated.
    - `newDataHash`: The hash of the new data to be associated with the identity.
- **Events**:
    - `IdentityUpdated`: Emitted when an identity is successfully updated.

$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
function updateIdentity(bytes32 identityId, address newDataHash) external;
        }
        ```

        EIP Documentation Snippet (if relevant to `updateIdentity`):
        <eip>
        No specific EIP segment found for this function.
        </eip>
        

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-14 03:42:29] ===
Here is the annotated function with appropriate postconditions for the `updateIdentity` function in the `ERC123` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC123 {
    address public owner;
    address public trustedVerifier;
    address dataHash;
    bool verified;
    mapping(bytes32 => Identity) private identities;
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) private consents;

    /// @notice postcondition identities[identityId].dataHash == newDataHash
    /// @notice postcondition identities[identityId].verified == (verified && newDataHash != identities[identityId].dataHash)
    /// @notice postcondition consents[msg.sender][identityId] || msg.sender == owner
    function updateIdentity(bytes32 identityId, address newDataHash) external;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`identities[identityId].dataHash == newDataHash`**: This postcondition ensures that after the function execution, the data hash associated with the specified identity ID is updated to the new data hash provided.

2. **`identities[identityId].verified == (verified && newDataHash != identities[identityId].dataHash)`**: This postcondition checks that if the identity is verified and the new data hash is different from the existing one, the verification status is maintained.

3. **`consents[msg.sender][identityId] || msg.sender == owner`**: This postcondition ensures that the caller either has consent for the identity update or is the owner, thus enforcing the access control logic of the function.
