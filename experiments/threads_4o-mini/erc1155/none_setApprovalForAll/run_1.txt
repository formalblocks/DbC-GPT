    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
        - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
        - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
        ``` 
        /// @notice postcondition condition1

        /// @notice postcondition condition2

        function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;
        ```

    Requirements:
        - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
        - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
        - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
        - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
        - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
        - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
        - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
   
    
    Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-14 02:54:37] ===
Based on the error messages and the requirements for the postconditions, it seems that the previous postconditions were too complex and introduced intermediate declarations or statements that are not allowed in the solc-verify annotations. 

Let's simplify the postconditions while ensuring they still capture the expected behavior of the `setApprovalForAll` function. The goal is to ensure that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly.

Here’s the revised version with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
    string private _uri;

/**
    @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
    @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
    @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
    @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
*/

/// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll(msg.sender, _operator) == _approved
/// @notice postcondition !(isApprovedForAll(msg.sender, _operator) == __verifier_old_bool(isApprovedForAll(msg.sender, _operator))) || isApprovedForAll(msg.sender, _operator) == _approved

function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **First Postcondition**: This checks that after the function execution, the approval status of the operator for the caller (`msg.sender`) matches the `_approved` parameter.
   
2. **Second Postcondition**: This ensures that if the approval status has changed (i.e., it was different before the function call), it now reflects the new `_approved` value. This avoids the introduction of intermediate statements by directly relating the state before and after the function execution without unnecessary complexity.

These changes should resolve the verification issues while still adhering to the requirements of the ERC1155 function.
