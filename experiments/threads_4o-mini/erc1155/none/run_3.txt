Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ``` 
    /// @notice postcondition condition1

    /// @notice postcondition condition2

    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;
    ```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.

Here is the annotated function with the appropriate postconditions for the `balanceOf` function in the ERC1155 contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
    string private _uri;

/**
    @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.

    /// @notice postcondition balance >= 0

    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **First Postcondition**: `balance == __verifier_old_uint(balanceOf(_owner, _id))`
   - This condition asserts that the balance returned by the function is equal to the balance of the owner for the specified token ID at the time of the function call. It ensures that the function returns the correct balance as expected.

2. **Second Postcondition**: `balance >= 0`
   - This condition ensures that the balance returned is non-negative, which is a necessary property for token balances.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **First Postcondition**: `forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _owners.length) || batchBalances[i] == __verifier_old_uint(balanceOf(_owners[i], _ids[i]))`
   - This condition asserts that for each index `i` in the `_owners` array, the balance returned in `batchBalances[i]` corresponds to the balance of the owner at `_owners[i]` for the token ID `_ids[i]` at the time of the function call. This ensures that the function correctly retrieves the balances for each specified owner and token ID pair.

2. **Second Postcondition**: `forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _owners.length) || batchBalances[i] >= 0`
   - This condition ensures that all balances returned in `batchBalances` are non-negative, which is a necessary property for token balances.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **First Postcondition**: `isApprovedForAll(msg.sender, _operator) == _approved`
   - This condition asserts that after the execution of the `setApprovalForAll` function, the approval status of the operator for the caller (the sender of the transaction) matches the `_approved` parameter. This ensures that the function correctly updates the approval status as intended.

2. **Second Postcondition**: `!(msg.sender == _operator)`
   - This condition ensures that the caller cannot approve themselves as an operator. This is a common restriction in token approval mechanisms to prevent self-approval, which could lead to unintended behavior.

Note: Since `isApprovedForAll` is a view function, it does not change any state, and thus we refer to the approval status directly as it is evaluated at the time of the function call.

Here is the annotated function with the appropriate postconditions for the `safeTransferFrom` function in the ERC1155 contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
    string private _uri;

/**
    @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
    @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
    MUST revert on any other error.
    MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).        
    @param _from    Source address
    @param _to      Target address
    @param _id      ID of the token type
    @param _value   Transfer amount
    @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to `onERC1155Received` on `_to`
*/
    /// @notice postcondition balanceOf(_from, _id) == __verifier_old_uint(balanceOf(_from, _id)) - _value
    /// @notice postcondition balanceOf(_to, _id) == __verifier_old_uint(balanceOf(_to, _id)) + _value
    /// @notice postcondition _to != address(0)

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **First Postcondition**: `balanceOf(_from, _id) == __verifier_old_uint(balanceOf(_from, _id)) - _value`
   - This condition asserts that after the transfer, the balance of the `_from` address for the token ID `_id` is decreased by the amount `_value` transferred. This ensures that the transfer is correctly reflected in the balance of the sender.

2. **Second Postcondition**: `balanceOf(_to, _id) == __verifier_old_uint(balanceOf(_to, _id)) + _value`
   - This condition asserts that after the transfer, the balance of the `_to` address for the token ID `_id` is increased by the amount `_value` transferred. This ensures that the transfer is correctly reflected in the balance of the recipient.

3. **Third Postcondition**: `_to != address(0)`
   - This condition ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address, which is a requirement for the transfer to be valid. This prevents tokens from being sent to an invalid address.

=== USER [2025-05-10 23:16:54] ===

Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ``` 
    /// @notice postcondition condition1

    /// @notice postcondition condition2

    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;
    ```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    string private _uri;

    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.
    MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.
    MUST revert on any other error.        
    MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
    After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **First Postcondition**: `forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || balanceOf(_from, _ids[i]) == __verifier_old_uint(balanceOf(_from, _ids[i])) - _values[i]`
   - This condition asserts that for each index `i` in the `_ids` array, the balance of the `_from` address for the token ID `_ids[i]` is decreased by the amount `_values[i]` transferred. This ensures that the transfer is correctly reflected in the balance of the sender.

2. **Second Postcondition**: `forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || balanceOf(_to, _ids[i]) == __verifier_old_uint(balanceOf(_to, _ids[i])) + _values[i]`
   - This condition asserts that for each index `i` in the `_ids` array, the balance of the `_to` address for the token ID `_ids[i]` is increased by the amount `_values[i]` transferred. This ensures that the transfer is correctly reflected in the balance of the recipient.

3. **Third Postcondition**: `_to != address(0)`
   - This condition ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address, which is a requirement for the transfer to be valid. This prevents tokens from being sent to an invalid address.

4. **Fourth Postcondition**: `_ids.length == _values.length`
   - This condition ensures that the length of the `_ids` array matches the length of the `_values` array, which is necessary for the function to operate correctly. This prevents mismatched transfers that could lead to errors.
