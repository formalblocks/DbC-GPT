=== USER [2025-05-25 02:17:19] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:18:04] ===
Certainly! The error you encountered indicates that the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function was incorrectly specified. Specifically, the postcondition should reference the return value directly rather than using an undeclared identifier.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:19:41] ===
The verification errors indicate that the postconditions for the `balanceOf` and `transferFrom` functions might not hold under certain conditions. We need to adjust the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the state changes that can occur during the execution of these functions.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
1. **For `balanceOf`:** The postcondition `balance >= 0` is unnecessary because the balance is always a non-negative integer due to the nature of counting tokens. We can remove this postcondition.
   
2. **For `transferFrom`:** The postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` might not hold if the transfer is not valid (e.g., if the caller is not the owner or an approved operator). We need to ensure that this postcondition only applies if the transfer is successful. We can use a conditional postcondition to reflect this.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the revised postconditions:

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under the various execution paths of the functions, addressing the verification errors.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:20:29] ===
The verification errors indicate that the conditional expressions in the postconditions for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions are incorrectly formatted. In the solc-verify syntax, we cannot use `if` statements directly in postconditions. Instead, we should use logical conditions to express the constraints.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
1. **For `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`:** We will use logical operators to express the conditions under which the postconditions hold. Specifically, we can use disjunctions (logical OR) to separate the conditions based on whether the transfer is valid or not.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced the conditional expressions** in the postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` with logical OR statements that check if `_from` or `_to` is the zero address. This ensures that the postconditions can hold true even if the transfer is not valid.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions are correctly formatted for the verifier.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:21:27] ===
The verification error indicates that the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function is still not correctly formulated. The condition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1 || _from == address(0)` is problematic because it suggests that the `_from` address could be the zero address, which is not valid in the context of transferring ownership of an NFT.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
1. **For `transferFrom`:** We need to ensure that the postconditions reflect the actual state changes that occur only when the transfer is valid. The `_from` address should not be the zero address when transferring an NFT. Instead, we can simply state that the counts should change only if the transfer is successful.

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed the conditional checks** for `_from` and `_to` being the zero address in the postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`. The postconditions now simply state that the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` should decrease by 1 and for `_to` should increase by 1, assuming the transfer is valid.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes during valid transfers and should resolve the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:22:13] ===
The verification error indicates that the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function still might not hold under certain conditions. Specifically, the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` may not be valid if the transfer is not executed successfully (e.g., if the caller is not the owner or an approved operator).

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
To address this, we need to ensure that the postconditions for `transferFrom` reflect the fact that the state changes only occur if the transfer is valid. We can use a logical condition to express that the postconditions only apply if the transfer is successful.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the revised postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

### Changes Made:
1. **Added conditions to the postconditions** for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` to ensure that the changes to `_ownedTokensCount` only apply if `_from` and `_to` are not the zero address. This prevents the postconditions from failing when the transfer is invalid.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes during valid transfers and should resolve the verification errors.

            ```

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:22:59] ===
The verification errors indicate that the conditional expressions in the postconditions for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions are incorrectly formatted. The `if` statements are not valid in the solc-verify syntax. Instead, we should use logical conditions to express the constraints without using `if`.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
We need to ensure that the postconditions are structured correctly without using `if` statements. Instead, we can use logical operators to express the conditions under which the postconditions hold.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed the `if` statements** from the postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`. Instead, we use logical conditions that allow for the possibility of `_from` or `_to` being the zero address without using `if`.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions are correctly formatted for the verifier and should resolve the verification errors.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:23:49] ===
The verification error indicates that the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function is still problematic. Specifically, the condition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1 || _from == address(0)` is not valid because `_from` should never be the zero address when transferring an NFT. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes only when the transfer is valid. The postconditions should only apply when the transfer is successful and should not include any conditions that could lead to an invalid state.

### Revised Postconditions:
1. **For `transferFrom`:** We will remove the condition that checks if `_from` is the zero address, as it is not valid for NFT transfers. We will simply state that the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` should decrease by 1 and for `_to` should increase by 1, assuming the transfer is valid.

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Removed the invalid conditions** that checked if `_from` or `_to` were the zero address from the postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`. The postconditions now only state that the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` should decrease by 1 and for `_to` should increase by 1, assuming the transfer is valid.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes during valid transfers and should resolve the verification errors.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:24:41] ===
The verification error indicates that the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function is still not correctly formulated. The condition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` might not hold if the transfer is not valid (e.g., if the caller is not the owner or an approved operator).

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
To address this, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes only when the transfer is valid. We can modify the postconditions to indicate that the changes to `_ownedTokensCount` should only apply if the transfer is successful.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the revised postconditions:
