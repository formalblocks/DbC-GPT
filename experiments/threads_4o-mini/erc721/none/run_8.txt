=== USER [2025-05-25 02:25:15] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:25:46] ===
Certainly! The error you encountered indicates that the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function was referencing an undeclared variable `isApproved`. Instead, we should ensure that the postcondition correctly references the return value of the function, which is `approved`. 

Here’s the corrected contract interface with the appropriate postconditions:

In this corrected version, the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` now correctly references the return value `approved`. This should resolve the verification errors you encountered.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:26:32] ===
The errors you encountered indicate that some postconditions may not hold under certain circumstances. Specifically, the postcondition `balance >= 0` for the `balanceOf` function and the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` for the `transferFrom` function may not always be valid.

### Adjustments:
1. **For `balanceOf`:** The balance should always be non-negative, but we can remove the explicit check since it is inherently true given the nature of the mapping. Instead, we can focus on ensuring that the balance returned matches the state variable.

2. **For `transferFrom`:** We need to ensure that the postconditions account for the case where the transfer might not occur (e.g., if the sender is not the owner). We can modify the postconditions to ensure they only apply when the transfer is valid.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

### Key Changes:
- **Removed the explicit non-negative check** from the `balanceOf` postcondition.
- **Modified the `transferFrom` postconditions** to account for cases where the transfer might not occur, using conditional checks based on the sender's address.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under the various conditions that may arise during function execution.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:27:19] ===
The errors you're encountering indicate that there are issues with the postconditions that involve comparing the `address` type with the result of `__verifier_old_uint`, which is intended for `uint256` types. This is causing type mismatch errors.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we are correctly referencing the previous state of the `address` type without using `__verifier_old_uint`. Instead, we can directly compare the current state with the previous state using a different approach.

### Adjustments:
1. **Remove the use of `__verifier_old_uint` for address comparisons.** We will simply check if the current owner matches the previous owner without attempting to convert the address type.
2. **Ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes without causing type errors.**

### Key Changes:
- **Removed the use of `__verifier_old_uint` for address comparisons.** The postconditions now only check the current state of `_tokenOwner` against the new owner `_to`.
- **Kept the original postconditions for the `_ownedTokensCount` mappings.** These should remain unchanged as they correctly reflect the expected state changes.

These changes should resolve the type mismatch errors and allow the verification process to proceed without issues.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:28:05] ===
The error you're encountering indicates that the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` for the `transferFrom` function might not hold at the end of the function. This can happen if the transfer is not valid (e.g., if the caller is not the owner, or if the transfer fails for any reason).

To address this, we need to modify the postconditions to ensure they only apply when the transfer is successful. We can use a conditional approach to check if the transfer actually occurs, ensuring that the postconditions reflect the state only when the transfer is valid.

### Adjustments:
1. **Use conditional checks** to ensure that the postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount` only apply when the transfer is successful.
2. **Ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes without causing false assumptions.**

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

### Key Changes:
- **Modified the postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount`** to include conditional checks based on whether the caller is the `_from` or `_to` address. This ensures that the postconditions only apply when the transfer is valid.
- **Retained the check for `_tokenOwner`** to ensure it reflects the new owner or remains unchanged if the transfer did not occur.

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under the various conditions that may arise during function execution, thereby resolving the verification errors.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:28:47] ===
The errors you're encountering are due to the incorrect use of `__verifier_old_uint` with address types. The postconditions should only reference state variables of the same type. Since `_tokenOwner` is an `address`, we should not use `__verifier_old_uint` on it. Instead, we can simply compare the current state with the previous state without trying to convert it.

### Adjustments:
1. **Remove the use of `__verifier_old_uint` for address comparisons.** We will compare the current state of `_tokenOwner` directly with the previous state.
2. **Ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes without causing type errors.**

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:29:37] ===
The error you're encountering indicates that the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` for the `transferFrom` function might not hold at the end of the function. This can occur if the transfer is not valid (e.g., if the caller is not the owner, or if the transfer fails for any reason).

To address this, we need to modify the postconditions to ensure they only apply when the transfer is successful. We can use a conditional approach to check if the transfer actually occurs, ensuring that the postconditions reflect the state only when the transfer is valid.

### Adjustments:
1. **Use conditional checks** to ensure that the postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount` only apply when the transfer is successful.
2. **Ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes without causing false assumptions.**

### Key Changes:
- **Modified the postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount`** to include conditional checks based on whether the caller is the `_from` or `_to` address. This ensures that the postconditions only apply when the transfer is valid.
- **Retained the check for `_tokenOwner`** to ensure it reflects the new owner or remains unchanged if the transfer did not occur.

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under the various conditions that may arise during function execution, thereby resolving the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:30:24] ===
The errors you're encountering indicate that the postconditions for the `transferFrom` function might not hold under certain conditions. Specifically, the postconditions that check the `_ownedTokensCount` for both the `_from` and `_to` addresses may not be valid if the transfer does not occur (e.g., if the caller is not authorized to make the transfer).

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the postconditions only apply when the transfer is valid. We can do this by checking that the transfer is indeed happening and that the caller is the owner or an authorized operator.

### Adjustments:
1. **Use a conditional approach** to ensure that the postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount` only apply when the transfer is successful.

### Key Changes:
- **Simplified the postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount`** to directly assert the expected changes when the transfer is valid. This assumes that the function will only be called when the transfer is valid, as the function itself has checks in place to ensure that.
- **Retained the check for `_tokenOwner`** to ensure it reflects the new owner.

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under the various conditions that may arise during function execution, thereby resolving the verification errors.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 02:32:15] ===
The error you're encountering indicates that the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` for the `transferFrom` function might not hold at the end of the function. This can happen if the transfer is not valid (e.g., if the caller is not the owner, or if the transfer fails for any reason).

To address this, we need to modify the postconditions to ensure they only apply when the transfer is successful. We can use a different approach to assert the changes to `_ownedTokensCount` based on the successful transfer.

### Adjustments:
1. **Use a single postcondition for `_ownedTokensCount`** that checks if the transfer was successful, rather than trying to conditionally check the state based on the caller.
2. **Ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes without causing false assumptions.**

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity

### Key Changes:
- **Retained the postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount`** but ensured they are directly linked to the successful transfer without conditional checks based on the caller.
- **The postconditions now assume that the function is called under valid conditions**, meaning the transfer will succeed if the preconditions are met.

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under the various conditions that may arise during function execution, thereby resolving the verification errors.
