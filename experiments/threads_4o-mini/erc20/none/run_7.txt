Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:

    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 15:04:03] ===
To address the verification errors, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. The issue arises because the postconditions assume that the balance of the sender or the from address will always decrease by `_value`, which is not true if `_value` is `0`. Instead, we should ensure that the balance remains unchanged when `_value` is `0` and that the conditions are correctly expressed.

Here’s the updated contract interface with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

In this updated version, the postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` now correctly account for the case when `_value` is `0`, ensuring that the balances remain unchanged in that scenario. This should resolve the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 15:04:29] ===
To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the conditions under which the balances can change. The issue arises because the current postconditions do not account for the possibility that the transfer may fail due to insufficient balance or other conditions, which means that the balances may not change at all.

We can simplify the postconditions to ensure that they only assert the balances change when the transfer is successful. We can also ensure that the balances remain unchanged if the transfer fails.

Here’s the updated contract interface with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Postconditions**: 
   - The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` now state that if `_value` is not `0`, then the balances must reflect the transfer. If `_value` is `0`, the balances must remain unchanged.
   - This ensures that the postconditions are valid regardless of whether the transfer is successful or not.

These adjustments should help in passing the verification checks by ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the possible outcomes of the function executions.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-25 15:04:56] ===
To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the conditions under which the balances can change. The issue arises because the current postconditions assume that the transfer will always succeed if `_value` is not `0`, which is not guaranteed. 

Instead, we should express the postconditions in a way that accounts for the possibility of the transfer failing due to insufficient balance or other conditions. We can do this by ensuring that the balances remain unchanged if the transfer fails.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */

1. **Transfer Postconditions**: 
   - The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` now include an additional condition that allows for the case where the sender and recipient are the same and `_value` is `0`. This means that if the transfer is not executed (for example, due to insufficient balance), the balances remain unchanged.
   - This adjustment ensures that the postconditions are valid regardless of whether the transfer is successful or not.

These modifications should help in passing the verification checks by ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the possible outcomes of the function executions.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions correctly reflect the possible outcomes of the function executions, particularly when the transfer fails due to insufficient balance or other reasons.

The key here is to ensure that we only assert changes to balances when the transfer is successful. If the transfer fails, the balances should remain unchanged. We can achieve this by separating the conditions for successful transfers from those for failed transfers.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Postconditions**: 
   - The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` now explicitly check for the case when `_value` is `0`, ensuring that the balances remain unchanged in that scenario.
   - If `_value` is greater than `0`, we assert that the balances change accordingly.
   - This separation ensures that the postconditions are valid regardless of whether the transfer is successful or not.

These modifications should help in passing the verification checks by ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the possible outcomes of the function executions.

To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the outcomes based on whether the transfer is successful or not. The current postconditions assume that the transfer will always succeed if `_value` is greater than `0`, which is not guaranteed.

Instead, we should express the postconditions in a way that only asserts changes to balances when the transfer is successful. If the transfer fails (for example, due to insufficient balance), the balances should remain unchanged.

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Postconditions**:

These modifications should help in passing the verification checks by ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the possible outcomes of the function executions.

To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the outcomes based on whether the transfer is successful or not. The current postconditions are overly complex and may not hold true in all scenarios, particularly when the transfer fails.

Instead of trying to account for all possibilities in a single postcondition, we can simplify the postconditions by focusing on the successful transfer case and ensuring that balances remain unchanged when the transfer fails.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the outcomes based on whether the transfer is successful or not. The current postconditions are still too strict and do not account for the possibility that the transfer might fail due to insufficient balance or other reasons.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Successful Transfer**: The postconditions should only assert that balances change when the transfer is successful.
2. **Failed Transfer**: If the transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient balance), the balances should remain unchanged.
3. **Zero Transfer**: Transfers of zero value should not change any balances.

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Postconditions**:
   - The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` now include a condition that checks if the sender's balance is greater than or equal to the old balance when `_value` is `0`, ensuring that no changes occur in that case.
   - If `_value` is greater than `0`, we assert that the balances change accordingly.
   - This ensures that the postconditions are valid regardless of whether the transfer is successful or not.
