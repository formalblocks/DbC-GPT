    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:42:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Notes:
- The postconditions make sure to handle cases where the function could fail (`_to` is zero address, insufficient balance, etc.), which are handled by the function reverting.
- Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` include maintaining the balance invariants and ensuring any necessary approvals are checked.
- The `forall` quantifier denotes the requirement that the condition holds for every element in the array (`_ids`). This is particularly applicable in `safeBatchTransferFrom`.
- The use of `success` in the earlier response was incorrect without using new context (success resolutions). Here, events are expected but not specific `success` variable handling.
- The state variable checks should ensure the amount is correctly debited from the sender and credited to the recipient unless it's a self-transfer. Note that error cases are assumed to revert in Solidity, so success scenarios relate to keeping balances in check.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:42:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes in Postconditions:
- The `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` functions now have conditions that ensure the returned balances match the contract's stored balances.
- The `setApprovalForAll` function reflects changes to operator approvals, confirming the approval mapping is updated and an event is emitted.
- The `safeTransferFrom` function postconditions handle balance updates, conditional on approvals and non-zero recipient address (`_to != address(0)`).
- The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function postconditions check array lengths, approvals, balance correctness for all elements, and event emission for batch transfers.
- The condition for the Approval status in `isApprovedForAll` is correctly related to `_operatorApprovals`.

This version should provide a thorough and consistent set of annotations ensuring formal verification while respecting the ERC1155 standard guidelines.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard

        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Details:
- `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` are annotated to relate directly to state variable `_balances`.
- `setApprovalForAll` ensures that the operator approval mapping updates correctly and an event is emitted.
- `isApprovedForAll` confirms that the returned status of operator approval matches the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
- `safeTransferFrom` ensures balance updates between `_from` and `_to`, checking for approvals and non-zero target address. Specific confirmation of event emission is mandated by ERC1155.
- `safeBatchTransferFrom` checks the length of `_ids` and `_values`. It verifies balances are adjusted for each token type in arrays, requires approvals, and emits batch transfer events matching ERC1155 requirements.
- The conditions ensure consistency with the standard implementation and cater to features like operator approvals and event emissions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:43:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations:
- **balanceOf**: Direct relation to the `_balances` state variable is maintained for the owner's token id balance.
- **balanceOfBatch**: Returns balances aligned with `_balances` for each owner-token pair.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the operator approval mapping, emitting the appropriate event.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Checks and retrieves if an operator is approved for all of the owner's tokens.
- **safeTransferFrom**: Ensures proper balance updates for both sender and recipient, requires valid address for `_to`, and manages approvals. The function maintains integrity on both success and failure, with expected event emission.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Verifies parallel update of multiple ids and values, ensuring consistent state for length checks, approvals, and event emission. Verifies integrity conditions for batched operations mimicking the "Safe Transfer Rules."

These annotations should help ensure correctness and adherence to ERC1155 standards while accommodating both potential success and failure scenarios as per contract requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:43:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations:
- **balanceOf**: Confirms that the balance returned matches the storage.
- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures correct pairing of IDs with owners and respective balances.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates approvals and guarantees event emission.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Checks the approval mapping and returns the correct status.
- **safeTransferFrom**: Verifies the correct balance updates, requires valid recipient address, manages proper event emission, checks operator approvals, and can handle both success and failure.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match, balances are correctly transferred in batch, ensures valid recipient, manages operator approvals, and confirms event emission in order of transfer.

These annotations strengthen the verification scope and ensure that the functions comply with the expected ERC1155 behaviors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:44:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations:
- **balanceOf** ensures that the balance returned directly matches the internal storage.
- **balanceOfBatch** ensures the input arrays are of equal length and that balances for each (owner, id) pair match what's stored.
- **setApprovalForAll** updates the approval state and emits an event to reflect this change.
- **isApprovedForAll** returns the correct approval status based on internal approvals mapping.
- **safeTransferFrom** and **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Ensure correct authorization checks (approval or ownership).
  - Ensure balances are appropriately updated for both the sender and receiver.
  - Handle the case for self-transfers in the condition.
  - Emit the correct event to reflect the change of state.
  - Require that the recipient is not the zero address.
  
These annotations are structured to match the logical flow and requirements of the ERC1155 standard, promoting clarity and correctness in formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:44:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Annotations:
- **balanceOf**: Postcondition verifies that the returned balance matches the contract's stored balance.
- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures input arrays have equal length, correctly return each pair's balance.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the approval mapping update and event emission.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the function returns the correct approval status.
- **safeTransferFrom** and **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Verify authorization is correct (approval or ownership).
  - Ensure balances update correctly for source and target.
  - Handle self-transfer gracefully.
  - Emit the necessary transfer events.

These annotations provide a formal verification framework consistent with the ERC1155 standard, encompassing correct function proposals, state transitions, and event emissions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:45:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the retrieved balance matches the stored balance.
- **balanceOfBatch**: Assures array lengths and each balance are correct.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Validates `_operatorApprovals` and event emission.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the correct approval status.
- **safeTransferFrom** and **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Check if the sender is approved or is the owner.
  - Validate proper balance adjustments for transfers.
  - Ensure event emissions reflect all balance changes.
  - Postconditions deal with both success and failure scenarios (self-transfers, insufficient funds).
  
These annotations fulfill the smart contract verification requirements, promoting robust ERC1155 token behavior while supporting formal verification practices.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Validates the balance returned matches the `_balances` mapping.
- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures both input arrays' lengths match, and returns balances as stored.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Reflects changes to the `_operatorApprovals` mapping and requires event emission upon successful execution.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Validates returned approval status using the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
- **safeTransferFrom** and **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Check for proper self-transfer handling mechanisms.
  - Ensure state changes regarding balances are correctly mapped to the execution conditions (success/failure).
  - Validate correct authorization either through approval or ownership.
  - Confirm event emission for transaction transparency.
  - Handle both cases for successful and unsuccessful operations. 

These annotations follow the ERC1155 specification to ensure the contract's reliability and security during verification processes.
