=== USER [2025-04-16 18:25:44] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To annotate the contract provided with appropriate formal specification postconditions using solc-verify syntax, we need to ensure that the behavior described in each function's postcondition accurately reflects the ERC-1155 standard. Below, you will find the annotated contract with postconditions:

```solidity

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf function**:
   - Ensures the returned balance matches the stored balance for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **balanceOfBatch function**:
   - Ensures that the length of returned balances matches the input array lengths.
   - Ensures all balances correspond correctly to each (`owner`, `id`) pair.

3. **setApprovalForAll function**:
   - Ensures that the operator approval status is set as requested, checking the condition under success and evaluating prior state if unsuccessful.

4. **isApprovedForAll function**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status.

5. **safeTransferFrom function**:
   - Validates that the transfer conditions meet the required checks such as non-zero `_to` address, sufficient balance, etc.
   - Considers the possibility of self-transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom function**:
   - Ensures input arrays are of matching length.
   - Validates the balance and non-zero address checks for each transfer in the batch, and accounts for self-transfers.
   
These postconditions provide the necessary guarantees expected from ERC-1155 compliant contracts, aligning with the protocol's expected behaviors and constraints.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:26:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
- **balanceOfBatch**: Checks that the returned balances correspond to their respective `(owner, id)` pairs and ensures the input arrays have matching lengths.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures the approval status is updated correctly, considering both success and failure cases.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies that the return value reflects the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **safeTransferFrom**: Verifies all conditions equivalent to a successful transfer (non-zero `_to`, sufficient balance, conditions for self-transfer) and considers the failure scenario where the previous balance remains unchanged if the function fails.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Ensures the input arrays have the same length and checks for successful batch transfers, considering scenarios for zero address `_to`, sufficient balance checks, possible self-transfers, and maintaining balance invariance in failure cases.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:26:43] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's annotate the given ERC1155 contract with proper formal verification postconditions according to the ERC standard and using `solc-verify` syntax. Each postcondition will accurately represent the expected behavior of the function as described in the standard.

```solidity

### Explanation
- **Postconditions for `balanceOf` function**: Verifies that the balance returned is the actual stored balance for the given owner and token ID.
- **Postconditions for `balanceOfBatch` function**: Ensures that the number of balances returned matches the input arrays and that each returned balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.
- **Postcondition for `setApprovalForAll` function**: Sets the approval status for an operator for the caller's tokens, ensuring this status is correctly updated.
- **Postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` function**: The approval status returned matches the stored approval status.
- **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`**: Handles standard transfer conditions including prevention of self-transfers. It confirms if the transfer is successful and especially handles the case for zero-address and underflows.
- **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Ensures that each transfer in the batch meets the conditions, with rules for batch processing and verifies that no transfer occurs if conditions aren't met anywhere in the process.

These annotations ensure formal verification checks align with the expected outcomes dictated by the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:27:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation
- **`balanceOf`**: Verifies that the balance returned is equal to the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures the returned `batchBalances` array has the same length as the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays. Each balance must match the corresponding `_balances` value.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures the approval status for `_operator` is correctly updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Verifies that the approval status returned matches the stored value.
- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensure success criteria such as proper balance updates, checks for zero address, and handling self-transfers with respective invariants in place.
  - Maintain correctness in balance post conditions aligned with transfers for both single and batch operations.

These postconditions are designed to formally verify that the functions act in compliance with the ERC-1155 standard, with particular attention to preventing errors such as insufficient balances and address mismatches.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:28:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The postcondition asserts that the function returns the correct balance for a given account and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - Checks if the lengths of input arrays `_owners` and `_ids` are equal, aligning with the length of `batchBalances`.
   - Ensures each `batchBalances` entry matches the corresponding balance in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Asserts changes in operator approvals are accurately updated according to input.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Asserts the function correctly returns the approval status for a given owner and operator defined in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`** and **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensure transfers obey the constraints of the ERC-1155 standard, including scenarios for successful and failed transactions.
   - Specifically cater to ensuring self-transfers do not incorrectly update balances, and address posting postcondition failures using logical separation of cases in the transactions.

These conditions aim to formalize expected behavior while maintaining compliance with the ERC-1155 standard. They also ensure logically consistent and secure operations for safe token state transitions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:28:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:28:30] ===
Let's correct the formal verification conditions and annotations for the given ERC1155 contract interface, with `solc-verify` postconditions that accurately reflect the expected ERC1155 behavior and resolve any previous issues or errors:

```solidity

    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

}

```

### Clarifications:
- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: These functions' postconditions ensure that return values directly reflect and are consistent with the stored state in `_balances`.
- **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Postconditions ensure approval status updates and checks reflect the expected `operator approval` logic.
- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Checks balances are correctly reduced on the `_from` account and increased on the `_to` account, giving consideration to success and potential failure results.
  - Self-transfers are implicitly managed by not affecting the state when `_from == _to`.
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensures matching array lengths and verifies balance adequacy before allowing batch operations.
  - Verifies state consistency after the batch transfer, with success and failure conditions making sure balances are only updated appropriately upon successful verification.

These enhancements ensure that the annotations match the expected behavior of ERC1155-compliant contracts under various circumstances, giving formal verification that aligns with technical specifications and best practices.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:28:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:29:00] ===
Here is the correct way to annotate the ERC1155 contract with formal verification conditions using `solc-verify` syntax. The postconditions ensure the behavior of each function aligns with the ERC1155 standard.

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested

    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens

    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

}
```

### Clarifications:

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the function returns the correct balance from `_balances`.
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Checks that the returned balances match the mapping values for each `(owner, id)` pair.
- **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Assert correct updating and querying of operator approval status.
- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Balances are correctly updated from `_from` to `_to` for the given `_id`.
  - Handles self-transfer cases where sender and recipient are the same by maintaining invariance.
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Checks for matching `_ids` and `_values` lengths.
  - Assures that changes in balances for each `(id, value)` pair are appropriately applied, incorporating measures for same-account transfers.

These annotations ensure the postconditions align with ERC1155's required functionality, addressing balance updates and approval impacts, with robust handling for special cases such as self-transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:29:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's add the correct formal verification postconditions to the given ERC1155 contract interface using `solc-verify` syntax, ensuring accurate representation of the ERC1155 standard. Here’s how the annotations should be applied:

```solidity

```

### Clarifications:

- **Postconditions for `balanceOf`**: Relates directly to `_balances`, asserting the balance returned matches the internal state.
  
- **Postconditions for `balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures arrays align in length and each returned balance matches values in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Updates and verifies operator approvals reflect changes as expected.

- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Enforce correct behavior by validating source and target balances appropriately decrement and increment, considering both successful operations and scenarios involving self-transfers where no net change should occur.
  - Ensure `_ids` and `_values` have matching lengths. 

These annotated postconditions should now correctly facilitate formal verification using tools like solc-verify to check that the contract satisfies ERC1155 constraints and correctly implements transfer and approval logic.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:29:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:30:03] ===
To add formal verification postconditions correctly, we'll ensure the conditions described align with the ERC1155 specification, utilizing `solc-verify` syntax for postconditions. Here's how the annotations should look for the functions specified:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
        /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    */
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs
        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token types requested (i.e. balance for each (owner, id) pair)
        /// @notice postcondition _owners.length == _ids.length
        /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i in 0.._owners.length-1) batchBalances[i] == _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]
    */
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /**

        @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.

        @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
        /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**
        @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
        @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account.
        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
        MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
        MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change.

        /// @notice postcondition ( _from == _to) || (_balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value)
    */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**

        MUST revert if length of `_ids` does not match `_values`.
        MUST emit the `TransferBatch` event to reflect all balance changes.
        @param _from    Source address
        @param _to      Target address

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Clarifications:

- **`balanceOf`**: Confirms that the balance returned corresponds directly to the balance stored in `_balances` for the given address and token ID.
  
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Verifies that the output array length matches the input, and assignments correspond to stored balances in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures changes and checks on operator approval status reflect updates correctly.

- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - These postconditions now properly reflect the required changes in balances when transfers are successful, while handling the cases for `_from` equaling `_to` (self-transfers) by ensuring no changes to balances occur in such instances.
  - Enforces error conditions through the guard clauses in the function specifications (e.g., ensuring the length of arrays for batch transfers match).

These annotations ensure the contract operates within expected boundaries of the ERC1155 standard, providing consistent and controlled behavior as desired, while allowing for formal verification using solc-verify or similar tools.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:30:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's address the errors in the annotation by correctly formatting the forall expressions in `solc-verify` and ensuring we maintain accurate postconditions for functions within the ERC1155 contract. Below is the corrected contract with proper annotations:

### Clarifications:

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the return value is the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.
  
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Checks that the length of output balances matches the input arrays and that each balance corresponds to the stored values.

- **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms that postconditions for setting and checking approvals reflect the intended updates or current states in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Makes sure self-transfers are accurately handled so the balances remain unchanged in those cases.
  - Validates that token balances are correctly adjusted in non-self-transfer scenarios.
  - Enforces constraints that align with ERC1155 batch transfer requirements including array length checks.

This ensures the contract is correctly annotated for formal verification in line with the ERC1155 specification and `solc-verify`'s requirements.
