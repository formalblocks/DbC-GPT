    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

To annotate this ERC1155 smart contract with proper solc-verify postconditions, we'll identify the behavior specified by the ERC1155 standard and translate these behaviors into annotations that describe the expected changes to the contract state, conditions for successful execution, or the expected return values. These annotations can help in formally verifying the contract using the solc-verify tool.

Here's the contract annotated with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    /**

    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /**

    */
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation

- **balanceOf**: The balance of a token ID for an account should directly match what is stored in `_balances`.

- **balanceOfBatch**: For batch operations, check the lengths of inputs and outputs align, and each resulting element should correspond to the balance of each owner/token pair.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensure the operator approval status matches the input approved value upon success.

- **isApprovedForAll**: The result should directly match the stored operator approval status.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Confirm the non-zero destination and ensure balances are updated correctly regarding sending and receiving addresses. Handle the case for sending to the same address.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Assert the destination is non-zero, and enforce balance operations for each pair conform to expected logic, with success conditions ensuring appropriate balance updates. Confirm input arrays are of equal length.

These annotations succinctly capture expected behavior per function based on the ERC1155 standard, helping developers formally verify the integrity of their smart contract implementation.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:15:09] ===
To correctly annotate this smart contract with postconditions using the `solc-verify` syntax and ensure compliance with the ERC1155 standard, I will provide the necessary annotations while addressing the errors from the form mentioned previously. These issues should be addressed by ensuring the syntax for quantifiers like `forall`, the use of `success`, and correct usage of state variables.

Here's the revised contract with proper annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    */
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
        @notice postcondition _owners.length == _ids.length
        @notice postcondition forall (uint256 i) (i < batchBalances.length ==> batchBalances[i] == _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]])
    */
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /**
        @notice postcondition (_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved && success) || (!success)
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**
        @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**
        @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
        @notice postcondition ((_balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value && _from != _to) || (_balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) && _from == _to )) && success 
        @notice postcondition ((_balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value && _from != _to) || (_balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) && _from == _to )) || !success
    */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**
        @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
        @notice postcondition _ids.length == _values.length
        @notice postcondition forall (uint256 i) (i < _ids.length ==> ((_balances[_ids[i]][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_balances[_ids[i]][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) && _from == _to)) && success)
        @notice postcondition forall (uint256 i) (i < _ids.length ==> ((_balances[_ids[i]][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_balances[_ids[i]][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) && _from == _to)) || !success)
    */
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Key Postcondition Annotations:

- **balanceOf:** Returns the balance of a specific token ID for a given owner as described by the `_balances` mapping.

- **balanceOfBatch:** Verifies the consistency in length between input arrays (_owners and _ids) and the returned `batchBalances`, while ensuring each element in `batchBalances` corresponds to their respective balances.

- **setApprovalForAll:** Ensures that the operator's approval status is updated correctly on success or remains unchanged on failure.

- **isApprovedForAll:** Directly returns the approval status from `_operatorApprovals`.

- **safeTransferFrom:** Handles individual token transfers, ensuring that balances update correctly for both source and destination accounts, with special handling for self-transfers. This must also ensure `_to` is not the zero address.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom:** Manages batch token transfers, ensuring balances are correctly updated as per the input arrays with their respective lengths matching (_ids and _values). It also verifies that for each transfer, balances adjust correctly given `success`, following the same non-zero address rule for `_to`. 

These annotations satisfy the formal verification requirements while aligning with the behaviors defined by the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:15:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:15:33] ===
In order to correctly annotate this smart contract interface with `solc-verify` postconditions and resolve the parsing issues, we need to ensure the syntax for conditions is correct and directly reflects the state of the contract according to the ERC1155 standard. Here’s the properly annotated code:

```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

### Explanation of Changes:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the function returns the `_balances` state value for the owner and token ID.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Appropriately checks for matching lengths of `_owners` and `_ids`, and verifies each balance in `batchBalances` matches the corresponding state value.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the operator approval status matches the `_approved` variable if the function is successful.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Directly corresponds to the stored approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **safeTransferFrom** and **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Ensure that balances reflect the transfers correctly, either decreasing from the sender and increasing to the recipient. Handle `success` and `!success` conditions to ensure that on error every invocation must leave the state unaltered. Include the necessary checks for valid parameters like non-zero `_to` address and array length matching.

These annotations align with the requirements for the ERC-1155 standard and aim to facilitate formal verification using `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:16:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:16:11] ===
To correctly add postconditions to the ERC1155 smart contract interface using solc-verify, we need to address some syntax errors seen in previous annotations attempts. These involve using the correct syntax for the `forall` construct and making sure to handle success conditions properly.

Here's the annotated contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

```

### Key Postcondition Descriptions:
- **balanceOf**: Simply checks if the retrieved balance matches the stored balance.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures the function respects array length constraints and that each balance returned matches the respective state variable entry.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Captures the result of setting approval status, comparing expected and actual approval states post-execution.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the stored approval status, mapping directly to `approved`.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Validates address constraints and correctly updates balances based on whether `_from` and `_to` differ, also handling the self-transfer case.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Ensures correct length matching and balanced state transitions for batch operations, incorporating wei transfers to and from as well as `result` status handling.

This setup should avoid previous syntax issues and clearly express the expected behaviors and conditions for successful execution as per the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:16:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

When adding formal verification conditions using solc-verify annotations, it is crucial to conform to its syntax and ensure each annotation properly describes post-execution state or response conditions. 

Here’s the corrected code annotated with proper syntax:

### Explanation

- `balanceOf`: Checks that the return value matches the state stored in `_balances`.

- `balanceOfBatch`: Ensures the length compatibility of arrays and confirms batch balances are correctly retrieved from the `_balances`.

- `setApprovalForAll`: Validates whether `_operatorApprovals` for a specific operator match the desired approval status on success, and remain unchanged otherwise.

- `isApprovedForAll`: Directly reflects the stored approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.

- `safeTransferFrom`: Asserts that the correct conditions regarding `_to` address and balances changes are upheld post-execution; accounts for possible "no-transfer" when `_from` equals `_to`.

- `safeBatchTransferFrom`: Similar to `safeTransferFrom` but applied to batch transfers; requires matching array lengths and ensures appropriate balance updates as indicated in the postconditions.

These postcondition annotations are aligned with the expectations from the ERC1155 standard and aim to facilitate formal verification while avoiding previous syntax errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:17:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);

To ensure correct formal verification conditions for the smart contract functions, the annotations must follow precise syntax. The errors you've encountered are likely due to solc-verify syntax mistakes or incorrect variable usage. We'll correct this and align with ERC-1155 standards, utilizing provided postcondition syntax accurately.

Here's the revised annotated ERC1155 contract:

### Key Changes and Explanations:

- **balanceOf and isApprovedForAll**: View functions that directly relate the return value to the state variables, reflecting the stored balances and approval status accurately.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures the function processes arrays correctly, confirming that `batchBalances` match the expected balances for given `_owners` and `_ids`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Validates the `_operatorApprovals` state update, conserving state on failure and successful state change representation.

- **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom**: Account for non-zero destination enforcement, length matching, and conditional balance updates contingent on the operation's success, accommodating both incremental changes on successful transfer and stable states on failure. This also handles self-transfers without changing account balances.

These annotations articulate the postconditions for each function, enhancing formal verification compatibility within the solc-verify system while adhering to ERC-1155 standards.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:17:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes and Annotations:
- **balanceOf and isApprovedForAll**: Annotations directly reflect storage mappings, ensuring return values are correct based on state variables.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Validates batch processing for each owner/id pair, ensuring array length preconditions are met and results accurately reflect state variables.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Handles post-state conditions depending on success or failure, with state preconditions ensuring logical consistency.

- **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom**: Addresses fundamental requirements for non-zero addresses, array matching where necessary, and state updates reflecting successful or failed operations. Special handling for self-transfers with invariant balances when `_from == _to`.

These annotations, formatted and extended appropriately, ensure clarity and compliance with the ERC-1155 standard, easing formal verification during smart contract analysis.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:18:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:18:30] ===
To resolve the annotation parsing issues and correctly annotate the smart contract with solc-verify postconditions, it’s important to adhere strictly to syntax rules. In particular, the syntax for universally quantified expressions (`forall`) should not use `in` but rather a simple range depiction `(i < N)`.

Here's the corrected version of the contract with appropriate postcondition annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json

**Key Adjustments and Explanations:**
1. **Syntax Correction for `forall`:** Changed from `forall (uint i in 0.._owners.length)` to `forall (uint i) (i < _owners.length)`, which uses correct syntax to indicate a range by comparing `i` against the length.

2. **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom Logic:**
   - Ensured annotations cover cases for both updates when `success` is true and leaves state unchanged when `success` is false.
   - Included handling for self-transfers ensuring balances don't change if `_from == _to`.

3. **Consistency Between Functions:** 
   - Ensured logic remained consistent between related functions such as in variants of transfer functions.
   - Correct and clear expressions ensure comprehensibility and relevant state association for each attribute checked.

These corrections use arithmetic checks and logical expressions tailored for addressing conditions stated by ERC-1155 requirements, aiming at aiding formal verification processes.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:19:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To properly annotate the ERC1155 smart contract with solc-verify postconditions, it's crucial to use the correct syntax and semantics expected by the tool. The errors you're experiencing generally stem from syntax and logic misalignments with solc-verify expectations.

Here's how you can annotate this contract accurately:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

### Key Points:
- **View Function Postconditions:** Ensure that postconditions for view functions (`balanceOf`, `isApprovedForAll`) directly relate return values to state variables.
- **Approval and Transfer Functions:** Handle both success and failure states for postconditions, verifying state changes or preservation.
- **Range Iteration:** When specifying iterator ranges for `forall`, ensure they reflect indices within valid bounds and align with solc-verify syntax.
- **Preconditions for Safety:** Always include critical preconditions like non-zero addresses and correct array lengths to uphold contract invariants, facilitating error prevention as part of verification.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Considerations

1. **Correct Syntax for Quantification:**
   - Use `(forall uint i; (...))` for quantifiers to ensure proper iteration over indices.

2. **Postconditions for View Functions:**
   - Ensure the return values directly reflect the mapped state variables.

3. **Handling of State Changes:**
   - Differentiate behaviors on success or failure, carefully reading updated values versus retaining old ones.

4. **Self-Transfers:**
   - Handling where `sender == recipient` to maintain balances unaltered should be clearly annotated.

These reflections streamline the formal verification with precise condition declarations, improving contract reliability and adherence to standards.
