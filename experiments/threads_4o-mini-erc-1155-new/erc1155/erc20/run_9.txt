    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These postconditions provide formal specifications for each function consistent with the ERC1155 standard and verification best practices. They consider the relevant state changes expected from token transfers and approvals, ensuring that all conditions align with the contract's functional requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:46:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

### Key Changes Made:

1. **balanceOfBatch:** Validated the length of `_owners`, `_ids`, and resulting `batchBalances` to ensure they are consistent and related. The `forall` condition iterates over each index to verify balance correctness across batches.

2. **safeTransferFrom:** Added postconditions to define changes in balances for `_from` and `_to`. Includes checks for success and edge cases where function can fail.

3. **safeBatchTransferFrom:** Included array length validation and applied balance changes for each token ID in a batch transfer.

These postconditions aim to ensure that the changes in state variables are as expected after the function execution, aligning with ERC1155 standard requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:47:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Changes Made:

- **Postconditions for `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:** Ensure the return values directly relate to the current balances in the `_balances` mapping.

- **Postconditions for `setApprovalForAll`:** Validate that `_operatorApprovals` state reflects the operation of setting approvals.

- **Postconditions for `isApprovedForAll`:** Confirm the return value accurately reflects the state of `_operatorApprovals`.

- **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`:** Add conditions ensuring
  - The caller is authorized (`msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender]`).
  - `To` address is valid and not zero.
  - Updates of balance mapping reflect the transaction (`success` or `failure`).

- **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Ensure array length checks for `_ids` and `_values` coexist with balance state transition requirements and account for caller authorization.

These postconditions provide a formal specification ensuring that the state changes in the smart contract comply with expected ERC1155 standard behavior.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:47:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Takeaways:

- The postconditions for view functions (`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`) assert that the return value directly relates to the state variable `_balances`.

- The postcondition for `setApprovalForAll` states that after the function call, the `_operatorApprovals` mapping reflects the approval status.

- For `isApprovedForAll`, the postcondition ensures the function returns the correct boolean value according to the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

- In `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, postconditions are added to ensure the balance changes reflect transfers correctly. When not successful, conditions must handle failure, maintaining original state.

By clearly specifying preconditions that lead to postconditions, these annotations help verifiers ensure that the functions perform as expected, meeting guidelines and behavior dictated by the ERC1155 standard.

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:48:21] ===
Given the task to add formal verification postconditions to the ERC1155 contract functions, here's the amended smart contract code with these constraints clearly specified using `solc-verify` syntax. Verification conditions have been accurately stated inline with ERC1155 specifications, capturing each function's expected behavior.

### Key Adjustments:

- **Self-transfer Condition Handling:** Implemented postconditions that handle same `from` and `to` conditions distinctly for both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`.

- **Approval and Non-zero Address Verification:** Added checks relevant to approvals and address validity to capture necessary preconditions that trigger these postconditions.

- **Batch Length Consistency:** Ensured that `_ids` and `_values` arrays conform in size, relevant to batch operations, including relevant forall conditions.

This annotated version of the contract reflects the apparent intended mechanics of ERC1155 multi-token operations, applying constraints and expectations defined in the original ERC1155 standard description.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:48:43] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Changes and Additions:

1. **BalanceOf and BalanceOfBatch**: Postconditions ensure return values match the state variables representing account balances.

2. **SetApprovalForAll**: Ensures the operator approval state matches the `_approved` flag that was set.

3. **IsApprovedForAll**: Verifies the return matches the stored approval state.

4. **SafeTransferFrom**:
    - Checks for successful approval and non-zero address conditions.
    - Verifies balance deductions and additions, accommodating self-transfer situations where `_from` equals `_to`.

5. **SafeBatchTransferFrom**: 
    - Array lengths must match before function execution proceeds.
    - Includes batch robustness in balance updates checks alongside the main invariants of _from, _to, and self-transfer cases.

These annotations incorporate critical state checks and the functionality embedded within the ERC1155 standard's logic.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:49:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

1. **Balance Retrieval Functions**:
   - `balanceOf` ensures the returned value matches the stored balance.
   - `balanceOfBatch` confirms the batch balances match per individual account-token pair.

2. **Set and Query Approvals**:
   - `setApprovalForAll` updates approvals according to the specified boolean value.
   - `isApprovedForAll` checks that the returned approved status corresponds to the stored mapping value.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` include postconditions to check:
     - Approvals and address non-zero preconditions.
     - Successful adjustments to balances according to different cases like self-transfers, handling both success and nonsuccess cases for the operations.

These annotations ensure that each function behaves according to the ERC1155 specifications, capturing essential invariants both before and after relevant execution points.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:49:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

1. **View Functions**:
   - `balanceOf` ensures the reported balance directly corresponds to the data in `_balances`.
   - `balanceOfBatch` confirms each balance in the returned array matches the respective `_balances` value, with array lengths validated against each other.

2. **Approval Functions**:
   - `setApprovalForAll` ensures that the `_operatorApprovals` map updates according to the input parameter `_approved`.
   - `isApprovedForAll` directly reflects the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

3. **Transfer Functions**: 
   - In `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, postconditions maintain that all necessary conditions (like approvals and non-zero `_to`) align with the specification, with the proper adjustment of balances depending on whether `_from` is the same as `_to` to properly account for self-transfer conditions and the general transfer behavior.
   - The updates to balances consider both successes and the need for handling self-transfers gracefully.

These annotations are guided by the expected invariants and logic inherent in the ERC1155 token standard, reflecting core functionalities and state updates.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:50:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Correct Logical Coverage**:
   - **`balanceOfBatch`**: An adjustment for handling empty arrays has been added, ensuring that when `batchBalances` is computed for zero-length arrays, the condition trivially holds.
  
2. **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - **Adjustments for Valid Transfers**: Ensure correct handling for cases of self-transfers versus actual asset migration between different accounts.

By ensuring these conditions are met, the annotations provide a robust mechanism for verifying adherence to the ERC1155 standard. Functions like `safeBatchTransferFrom` now safely account for both states where `_from` equals `_to` and handle cases of user approvals alongside token balance checks.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:51:14] ===
To correctly annotate the smart contract and address the verification errors, we need to slightly adjust and clarify the postconditions to comply with the logical requirements and possibilities within the contract's mechanics:

- Ensure the conditions cover both success and failure paths, aligning with `ERC1155` rules.
- Make sure each postcondition accounts for state changes when `_from` equals `_to`.

Here's an attempt to enhance the accompanying conditions correctly, detailed below:

```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
    string private _uri;

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Enhanced Logical Coverage**:
   - Addressing empty array use cases, especially in `balanceOfBatch`.
   - Added conditions that cover non-transfer operations/validations correctly.

2. **State Transition Clarity**:
   - Ensure correct deductive logic across batch/single operations for both arrays and checking states when sender and receiver are identical.
  
By understanding the wider implications and nuances in transfer and balance retrieval methods, this contract provides explicit assurances of proper state-transitioning behavior per the ERC and business logic requirements.
