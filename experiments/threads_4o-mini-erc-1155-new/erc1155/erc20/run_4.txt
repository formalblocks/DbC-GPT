=== USER [2025-04-16 18:20:17] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This specification includes postconditions tailored to the behavior of ERC1155 functions. Each function’s annotations express the constraints and expectations for variable values after the function execution, ensuring compliance with the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:20:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This code now includes postcondition annotations for each function in the `ERC1155` contract. These annotation statements capture the expected changes to the contract's state after each function is executed, consistent with the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:21:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations reflect the expected behaviors as per the ERC1155 standard. They detail conditions such as equality and inequality checks for balances, approval states, event emissions, and address validations consistent with caller permissions and transfer security.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:21:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

These annotations clearly capture the conditions surrounding the balances before and after function execution, approval states, event emissions, and address validations tailored for both batch and individual transfers while maintaining consistency with the intent of the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:21:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:21:54] ===
Here is the ERC1155 contract annotated with proper solc-verify postconditions for formal verification. I've made necessary adjustments for readability and correctness based on the ERC1155 standard and your provided guideline:

```solidity

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**

    */
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

These annotations ensure that the changes to the state variables within the functions are stated clearly. The preconditions and postconditions accurately capture the required expectations of how balances and approvals should update. This provides a formal way to verify and ensure the contract behaves as expected based on the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:22:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
- **Consistency Checks:** Conditions check indexes (`i`) across `_owners`, `_ids`, and `_values` to ensure they are applicable for each pair, and their lengths match.
- **Precondition fails:** Ensure preconditions, such as balances being checked before transfers, are accurate and enforce that the transfer should be possible (like checking `_balances[_id][_from] >= _value`).
- **Balance Updates:** Balances for `_from` and `_to` must reflect changes or remain unchanged correctly based on whether the transfer was a self-transfer.
- **Operator Approvals:** The conditions check whether the operator is approved or if the sender is the owner themselves.

These postconditions set up scenarios ensuring the intended functionalities of transfers, balances, and authorizations remain compliant with the ERC1155 standard. Adjustments may be necessary if handling specific execution contexts or using a precise toolchain beyond solc-verify.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:23:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **Guard Clauses for Arrays Length:** The `balanceOfBatch` function now includes postconditions ensuring that `_owners` and `_ids` arrays have the same length.
  
- **Self-Transfer Handling:** Both the `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` methods include conditional postconditions for when `_from` equals `_to`.

- **Balance Constraints and Success Handling:** For both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, conditions ensure state updates are accurate regarding pre-transfer and post-transfer balances, plus appropriate handling for validity checks that might cause a failure.

These interventions reflect logical integrity checks that align with expectations from the ERC1155 standard while accommodating formal verification rules.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:23:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'

        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Let's address the error and improve the clarity of the postcondition annotations for the ERC1155 contract interface to ensure they correctly model the expected contract behavior according to the verification guidelines.

### Explanation:

- **View Functions:** The `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` functions return the token balances directly related to the `_balances` mapping, ensuring these are postcondition checks.

- **Self-Transfers and Approvals:** The `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions handle both successful transfers (`success` being implicit here) and self-transfers where `_from == _to`, ensuring balances are unchanged appropriately in the latter case.

- **Length & Index Checks:** For `balanceOfBatch`, the lengths of `_owners` and `_ids` are validated against `batchBalances`.

- **Result Accuracy:** The result postconditions are formulated to match the expected effect of each transaction and the contract's state changes, confirming that balances only update when transfers occur and are otherwise consistent.

These modifications ensure that functions exhibit the expected behavior dictated by the ERC1155 standard, integrating formal verification requirements through appropriate syntax.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:24:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:24:18] ===

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**

}
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Postconditions Reflect Transfers:**
   - For `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, the conditions track the simple decrement of the `_from` and increment of `_to`. They account for whether a transfer is successful or not (`!success`), which involves balances remaining unchanged.

2. **Self-Transfers Handled Separately:**
   - Self-transfer (`_from == _to`) behavior has been explicitly addressed, ensuring that the balance does not change.

3. **Array Length Checks:**
   - In `balanceOfBatch` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, the annotations verify array lengths, ensuring that preconditions meet expected sizes.

These annotations are consistent with standard practices and ERC1155's specifications, providing a reliable formal verification scaffold.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:24:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's annotate the smart contract interface with formal verification postconditions according to the ERC1155 standard. We'll make sure the conditions reflect the necessary checks to ensure correct behavior concerning balances, authorizations, and transfers. Below is the modified contract interface with annotations using `solc-verify`.

```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

```

### Explanation

1. **Array Lengths:**
   - `balanceOfBatch`: Ensures `_owners` and `_ids` arrays have the same length, and `batchBalances` corresponds correctly.

2. **Approvals:**
   - `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`: Check and maintain `_operatorApprovals`.

3. **Transfers:**
   - Both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`: Properly check self-transfers (when `_from == _to`) to ensure relevant balance changes are accurately captured.
   - Ensure `safeBatchTransferFrom` has conditions to prevent execution if `_to` is a zero address and arrays `_ids` and `_values` do not match in length or content.

These postconditions represent a cohesive formal verification strategy that closely aligns with the ERC1155 standard's expected behavior.
