=== USER [2025-04-16 18:36:59] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations specify expected changes to the contract's state and conditions under which the functions should succeed or maintain consistency according to the ERC1155 standards.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:37:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

These annotations provide formal verification annotations for the ERC1155 contract's functions, capturing the expected state changes and ensuring compliance with the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:37:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations Explained:
1. **`balanceOf()`**:
   - Relates return value directly to the state variable `_balances`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch()`**:
   - Ensures that the result batch balances are correctly correlated with `_balances` for each given `(owner, id)` pair.
   - Asserts that `_owners` and `_ids` have the same length as `batchBalances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll()`**:
   - Ensures that the approval state is correctly set for the given operator.

4. **`isApprovedForAll()`**:
   - Relates the return value directly to the stored operator approval state.

5. **`safeTransferFrom()`**:
   - Checks that the balance of `_from` decreases by `_value` and increases for `_to`, handling self-transfers appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom()`**:
   - Ensures that each element in `_ids` and `_values` transfers—and balance updates—occur in parallel, maintaining the balance consistency for both sender and receiver.

These annotations guide formal verification tools to check if operations on the state variables comply with expected behaviors, ensuring safety and correctness according to the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:38:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations Explanation
1. **`balanceOf()`**:
   - Relates the return value directly to the `_balances` state variable.

2. **`balanceOfBatch()`**:
   - Asserts that `_owners` and `_ids` have the same length.
   - Relates each value in `batchBalances` with its corresponding `_balances` state, ensuring it reflects the balances for the `(owner, id)` pair.

3. **`setApprovalForAll()`**:
   - Confirms the `_operatorApprovals` mapping is updated to reflect the new approval status.

4. **`isApprovedForAll()`**:
   - Directly relates the return value to the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom()`**:
   - Ensures token balance is correctly transferred from `_from` to `_to`, considering self-transfer conditions.
   - Updates balances accordingly and emits the correct event.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom()`**:
   - Checks that the length of `_ids` and `_values` are equal.
   - Ensures each token batch transfer updates balances properly, considering each token type.
   - Updates balances properly and emits the corresponding batch transfer event.

These annotations enforce the expected state changes for each major operation, guaranteeing compliance with the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:38:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Annotations:

1. **`balanceOf()`**:
    - Directly ties the returned balance to the state variable `_balances`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch()`**:
    - Ensures the lengths of `_owners` and `_ids` match.
    - Validates that each index correctly represents the account balance.

3. **`setApprovalForAll()`**:
    - Ensures the update of the approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **`isApprovedForAll()`**:
    - Relates the return value to the recorded approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom()`**:
    - Checks the changes in `_balances` post-transfer, accounting for a self-transfer scenario.
    - Ensures no change to balances when `_from` equals `_to`.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom()`**:
    - Ensures the balance arrays are of equal length.
    - Verify balance deduction for each token transferred and adjustment for both `from` and `to`.

These annotations enforce checks that mirror the conditions stipulated by the ERC1155 standard. They aim to ensure the contract operates exactly as required by that specification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:39:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Annotations:

1. **`balanceOf()`**:
   - The balance returned is directly related to `_balances` for the specific `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch()`**:
   - Ensures the length of `_owners` and `_ids` matches.
   - Verifies that each balance in the returned array (`batchBalances`) corresponds to the respective balance stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll()`**:
   - Confirms that `_operatorApprovals` accurately reflects the new approval state for the operator.

4. **`isApprovedForAll()`**:
   - The returned value `approved` directly corresponds to `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom()`**:
   - Guarantees correct state changes in `_balances` when transfers occur, with special handling for transfers where `_from` is `_to`.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom()`**:
   - Validates equal lengths for `_ids` and `_values`.
   - Ensures each token transfer in the batch correctly updates `_balances`, handling scenarios where `_from` is `_to` appropriately.

These postconditions serve a dual purpose: they define expected behaviors to enable formal verification of contract code and ensure compliance with established ERC1155 standards.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:39:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:40:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

1. **`balanceOf()`**:
   - Ensures the `balance` return matches the stored balance in `_balances`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch()`**:
   - Checks that the `batchBalances` length matches `_owners`.
   - Deals with each balance element, ensuring they match `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll()`**:
   - Confirms the proper update of `_operatorApprovals` for the given operator.

4. **`isApprovedForAll()`**:
   - Ensures the approval status corresponds with `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom()`**:
   - Verifies proper balance updates post-transfer considering `_to` and `_from` addresses.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom()`**:
   - Ensures the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` correspond.
   - Validates each token is transferred accurately, maintaining consistency based on whether `_from` is `_to`.

These annotations are meant to establish intuition around desired postconditions following each function execution as per the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:40:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 18:40:40] ===
To provide formal verification conditions for the ERC1155 functions, I'm adding appropriate `solc-verify` postconditions that align with the ERC standard requirements and adhere to the verification guidelines provided.

Here's the modified contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

### Explanation of Annotations:

1. **`balanceOf()`**: Ensures the returned balance is directly tied to `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch()`**: Confirms that the returned `batchBalances` array corresponds correctly to each `(owner, id)` pair, ensuring length consistency between `_owners` and `_ids`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll()`**: Validates that `_operatorApprovals` reflects the correct `_approved` status after the function execution.

4. **`isApprovedForAll()`**: The return value `approved` matches the recorded approval state in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom()`**: Verifies changes in `_balances`, ensuring correct adjustments for transfers, and handles self-transfers appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom()`**: Checks that each transfer in the batch properly updates `_balances` and ensures `_ids` and `_values` are appropriately paired, including ensuring no changes if `_from` equals `_to`.

These annotations are structured to comply with the ERC1155 standard and use formal language to describe expected changes or invariants in the contract state after each function execution, facilitating formal verification tests.

=== USER [2025-04-16 18:41:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Annotations:

1. **`balanceOf()`**: The balance returned should match the `_balances` mapping for the specific `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch()`**: Ensures the length of `_owners` matches `_ids`, and each element in `batchBalances` corresponds correctly to `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll()`**: Confirms the operator's approval status is correctly set in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **`isApprovedForAll()`**: Reflects the approval status from `_operatorApprovals` as returned by the function.

5. **`safeTransferFrom()`**: Requires correct balance deductions and additions per the transfer, ensuring no change if `_from` equals `_to`.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom()`**: Ensures `ids` and `values` arrays are the same length and balance transfers are completed accurately, handling each element distinctly per `_id` and `_value`.

These annotations serve as formal requirements for verifying the contract's compliance with ERC1155, providing a framework for expected behaviors post-execution.
