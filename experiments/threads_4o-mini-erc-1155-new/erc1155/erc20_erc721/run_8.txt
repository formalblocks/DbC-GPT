    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:13:52] ===
To properly annotate the ERC1155 smart contract interface with formal postconditions, let's follow the task requirements and verification guidelines. We'll focus on ensuring that these annotations accurately reflect the intended behavior of each function as specified in the ERC1155 standard:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
    string private _uri;

    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner][_id] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _ids.length
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(_owners.length > i) || _balances[_owners[i]][_ids[i]] == batchBalances[i]
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /// @notice postcondition ( ( _balances[_from][_id] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_balances[_from][_id]) - _value  &&  _from != _to ) || ( _from == _to ) )
    /// @notice postcondition ( ( _balances[_to][_id] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_balances[_to][_id]) + _value  &&  _from != _to ) || ( _from == _to ) )
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /// @notice postcondition _ids.length == _values.length
    /// @notice postcondition (forall (uint i) !(_ids.length > i) || ( ( _balances[_from][_ids[i]] ==  __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_ids[i]]) - _values[i]  &&  _from != _to ) || ( _from == _to ) ))
    /// @notice postcondition (forall (uint i) !(_ids.length > i) || ( ( _balances[_to][_ids[i]] ==  __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_ids[i]]) + _values[i]  &&  _from != _to ) || ( _from == _to ) ))
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned balance for a specific owner `_owner` and token ID `_id` aligns with the stored balance in `_balances`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The postconditions confirm that the result array `batchBalances` has a length equivalent to both `_owners` and `_ids` input arrays.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds correctly to the balance mapped in `_balances` for paired `_owners[i]` and `_ids[i]`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - The state change in `_operatorApprovals` reflects the approval status (`_approved`) for the operator provided by the caller (`msg.sender`).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - The function returns a boolean `approved` that matches the current approval status for an operator managing tokens of a specified owner.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Postconditions ensure that if `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the balance for `_from` is decreased by `_value` and `_to`'s balance is increased by `_value`. After this operation, state variables reflect these changes.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Postconditions affirm that the input arrays `_ids` and `_values` are of the same length.
   - For each index `i`, if `_from` differs from `_to`, `_balances` for each `_id[i]` is decreased by `_values[i]` for `_from` and correspondingly increased for `_to`. This ensures that the batch transfer adjusts balances as expected across multiple entries.

These formal annotations serve as verifiable statements reflecting the smart contract's expected behavior, supporting automated proofs and potential audits of compliance with the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:14:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:14:21] ===
To address the errors and correctly annotate the ER1155 smart contract interface, let's fix the data type specification in the postconditions. The main issue seems to be misuse of `uint256` identifiers for array indexing and other minor syntax errors. Here's a revised version correcting these points:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _ids.length
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i in 0 .. _owners.length) _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]] == batchBalances[i]
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /// @notice postcondition (( _balances[_id][_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_balances[_id][_from]) - _value ) && ( _from != _to ) && success) || (!success)
    /// @notice postcondition (( _balances[_id][_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_balances[_id][_to]) + _value ) && ( _from != _to ) && success) || (!success)
    /// @notice postcondition (( _balances[_id][_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_balances[_id][_from]) ) && ( _from == _to )) || (!success)
    /// @notice postcondition (( _balances[_id][_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_balances[_id][_to]) ) && ( _from == _to )) || (!success)
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /// @notice postcondition _ids.length == _values.length
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i in 0 .. _ids.length) 
    ///          (( _balances[_ids[i]][_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i] &&  _from != _to ) || ( _from == _to ) ) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i in 0 .. _ids.length) 
    ///          (( _balances[_ids[i]][_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i] &&  _from != _to ) || ( _from == _to ) ) || !success
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Key Updates:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Fixed the indexing in the `_balances` map from `[_owner][_id]` to `[_id][_owner]` which accurately depicts how balances are being mapped.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Corrected the forall loop declaration to use a proper range iteration mechanism as supported by `solc-verify`.
   - Adjusted `_balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]` to align with the presumed mapping structure.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` & `isApprovedForAll`**:
   - These functions relate to approval status, and their verification conditions reflect state relevance to operator approvals.

4. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Revised postconditions assuming success conditions are separate from failure ones.
   - Clarification and separation for conditions when `_from` equals `_to`.

5. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Standardized assertions for all indices `i` in `_ids` along with checks regarding transaction success.
   - Enforced mapping structure in verification conditions similar to `balanceOfBatch`.

These corrections reflect the intended behavior of the ERC1155 standard and account for the relationships between token management and state changes linked to transfers and approvals.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:15:30] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:

1. **`forall` Loops**:
   - Corrected the syntax to iterate with standard C-style loops (`uint i = 0; i < ...; i++`), a more universally accepted syntax in formal specification tools.

2. **Postconditions for Success and Failure Cases**:
   - Handled both success (`&& success`) and failure cases (`|| !success`) for transfers by keeping consistent with the guideline of handling self-transfers.

3. **General Syntax Adjustments**:
   - Ensured logical expressions are grouped properly with parentheses for clarity.
   - Fixed ordering and logic errors to ensure correct meaning of comparisons.

These corrections address syntax issues and ensure that each annotation follows the ERC1155 specification requirements, properly reflecting the expected state changes and invariants of the smart contract functions.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:15:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Loop Syntax**:
   - Corrected the `forall` loop syntax to ensure it matches what's supported for formal specification verification.

2. **Success and Failure Handling**:
   - Added commentary to properly reflect both states for transfer functions. This ensures coverage for both failing and successful transactions.

3. **Self-Transfers Handling**:
   - Explicit conditions for scenarios where `_from == _to` to ensure that in such cases balances remain unchanged, and the behavior is consistent with transfer mechanics.

4. **Balance Changes**:
   - Verified that changes to balances follow logically expected transitions, capturing possible state revert conditions like zero addresses, outweighing transfers, and specified rules for contract checking.

These adjustments ensure correctness, avoid logical conflicts or syntax errors, and adhere closely to the intended ERC1155 standard mechanics.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:16:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Amendments:

1. **Corrected `forall` Syntax**: 
   - Correct the `forall` syntax to use `uint i; i < condition;` which denotes iteration logic within the constraints of the verifier.

2. **Use of Boolean Expressions and Consistency**:
   - Ensure boolean expressions handle all the states (including no-ops on transfers to self and failure cases) consistently across both individual and batch transfers.

3. **State Variable Referencing**:
   - Used `__verifier_old_uint` to reference the state prior to a function call—this is critical for tracking changes across operations especially where reverts are involved.

This implementation should be more suited for verification while effectively reflecting the contract logic as stipulated in the ERC1155 standards.

        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:16:49] ===
To properly annotate the ERC1155 smart contract interface with formal postconditions using `solc-verify`, we'll need to fix the syntax errors in the annotations and ensure each postcondition represents the intended behavior as specified by the ERC standard. Let's improve the syntax for the `forall` quantifier and refine the postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution
    string private _uri;

    /**

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`forall` Syntax**: 
   - I've replaced erroneous loop syntax with `forall (uint i, limit)`, a more suitable placeholder assuming the verifier understands this expression to iterate over a range within memory structures.

2. **Balance Check and Update Conditions**:
   - The conditions inside `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` ensure that the balances are appropriately decremented from `_from` and incremented to `_to`, but only if the transfer is successful, reflecting typical token transfer logic.

3. **Self-Transfer Handling**:
   - Special handling for when `_from` equals `_to`, ensuring no changes in account balances to jot down self-transfer scenarios.

4. **Success and Failure Handling**: 
   - Properly ensures that if any checks fail that block a transfer, no changes are committed, showcasing included error handling via `|| !success` logic.

This should encompass the primary logical structure and intended functional invariants of the ERC1155 contract. Make sure the verification language you are using supports this style of logic; some adjustments may be necessary for your specific toolchain if not using `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:17:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:17:14] ===
To correctly annotate the ERC1155 smart contract with verifiable postconditions, it is important to adapt the annotations properly and fix syntax errors related to the quantifiers in the postconditions. Each annotation must clearly express the expected outcomes as per the ERC1155 specification. Let's update the contract interface with improved postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

        @param _ids    ID of the tokens

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Correct `forall` Usage**:
   - Ensure that the `forall` syntax correctly uses the range for iteration. In the given context, using `(uint i in 0 .. _owners.length)` specifies the domain over which the balances are verified.

2. **Transfer Success/Failure Handling**:
   - The postconditions for both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` now handle both success and failure cases by considering cases when balances remain unchanged should the operations fail.

3. **Self-Transfer Special Handling**:
   - Conditions ensure that if `_from` equals `_to`, the balance changes do not occur, supporting no-operations when transferring to oneself.

4. **Logic Consistency**:
   - Use of `__verifier_old_uint` to reference pre-function call balances, alongside logical conditions to check that operations are only recorded as successful if all constraints (such as non-zero target address, sufficient balance) are satisfied.

These annotations should align with typical ERC1155 contract logic and verification needs. Ensure these are aligned with your verification tool's syntax and supported constructs.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:17:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

Let's refine the annotations, fixing syntax errors and ensuring postconditions correctly capture the contract logic, including self-transfers, balance updates, and success/failure cases. Below is the annotated ERC1155 interface with corrected postconditions using `solc-verify` syntax:

```

### Key Changes:

1. **Correct `forall` Usage**: 
   - Changed the `forall` quantifier to adhere to typical range iteration `uint i = 0; i < expression; i++` to inspect each element inside the array correctly.

2. **Success Path Consistency**:
   - Ensure postconditions account for all potential successful paths, including self-transfers, so no unexpected deductions/additions occur if the sender `_from` is the same as the receiver `_to`.

3. **Logic and State before Change**:
   - The use of `__verifier_old_uint` for state captures accounts for balances before potential deductions/additions, providing a reliable means to verify post-state alignment with intended operations. 

4. **Revert Condition Handling**:
   - Added logic handling `!success` to represent states where transactions may not execute successfully, ensuring these cases do not illegally alter state.

These corrections align with ERC1155's intended design guidelines and anticipated audit practices, providing a foundation for automated or manual correctness checks.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:18:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:18:10] ===
Let's correctly annotate the ERC1155 contract with appropriate postconditions for formal verification. We can fix syntax issues in the annotations and ensure they accurately represent the logic and behavior according to the ERC1155 standard. Here’s how each function can be annotated:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution
    string private _uri;

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

        @param _ids    ID of the tokens

    */
    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length

    */
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**

}
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Forall Loop Fix**: 
   - Changed `forall` annotation syntax to use a more typical loop expression, structured correctly to apply the conditions within expected ranges.

2. **Conditions for Success and Failure**:
   - For `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions, postconditions include success and failure paths, checks for zero addresses, and ensure operations reflect token transfer logic correctly.

3. **Self-Transfer Handling**:
   - Managed with conditions that check `_from == _to` to ensure balances are not incorrectly altered when tokens are logically sent to the same address.

4. **Clustered Postconditions**:
   - Logical conditions are clustered with `success` and `!success` terms to specify which operational pathways each corresponds to within different execution states.

These annotations effectively articulate each function's intended operation and provide a framework for formal verification that closely adheres to ERC1155's standards. Always validate alignment with the particular language or verifier syntax being applied.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:18:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:18:36] ===
To address the errors and ensure the proper use of `solc-verify` syntax for postconditions, let's refactor the annotations for each function. Here’s an improved version with comments adjusted:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution
    string private _uri;

    /**

        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs.
        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens

    */
    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _ids.length

    */
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Correct `forall` Syntax**:
   - Correct `forall` syntax to `uint i in 0 .. length` to specify valid loop ranges explicitly.

2. **Condition Corrections**:
   - Adjusted postconditions for clarity and correctness, ensuring they correctly reflect balances before and after transfer operations, handling success and failure scenarios.

3. **Treatment of Self-Transfers**:
   - Conditions ensure that self-transfers ([i.e.](http://i.e.) `_from == _to`) don't affect balances.

4. **Reflection of Success Cases**:
   - The postconditions effectively handle both success and potential failure cases using `|| !success` to denote when transfers do not result or alter balances.

These corrections ensure compatibility with `solc-verify` syntax requirements and capture each function's intended effects according to ERC1155 guidelines. Ensure each annotation aligns with the specification your verifier supports, as specific tool syntax may necessitate slight variations.
