    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation of Annotations:
- For `balanceOf`, we specify that the result reflects the current balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified `(_id, _owner)` pair.
- For `balanceOfBatch`, we ensure the length of the output array matches the input arrays and that each element reflects balances as requested for each `(_owner, _id)` pair.
- For `setApprovalForAll`, we ensure the mapping reflects the approval status set by the caller for a specific operator.
- For `isApprovedForAll`, the return value should match the current state of the approval mapping for the specified `(_owner, _operator)` pair.
- For `safeTransferFrom`, we handle balance updates ensuring that after execution, balances reflect the transfer (considering possible self-transfers).
- For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for an array of token types and quantities, ensuring all balances are updated consistently according to the specified transfers.

These specifications are consistent with the requirements and behaviors described in the ERC1155 standard documentation.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:42:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:42:40] ===
The task is to annotate the ERC1155 contract’s functions with appropriate postconditions using the solc-verify syntax. Let's fix the issues and complete the annotations by writing proper postconditions for each function, incorporating necessary verification conditions.

### Key Points of the Annotations:

- **balanceOf**: The returned balance should match the recorded balance in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
- **balanceOfBatch**: The returned `batchBalances` should have a length equal to `_owners` and `_ids` and each element reflects the balance in `_balances` for each `(owner, id)` pair.
- **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the specified `_operator` should match the `_approved` input after the operation.
- **isApprovedForAll**: The returned boolean should reflect the actual approval status of `_operator` for `_owner` in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **safeTransferFrom**: Updates to `_balances` should reflect the transfer amount for both `_from` and `_to`, accounting for self-transfers where `_from == _to`.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Completes postcondition for batch transfers reflecting changes in `_balances` for each token type specified in `_ids`.

These specifications are now aligned with the ERC1155 standard behavior and should resolve any original errors while also clearly capturing the intended modifications in token balances and approval status.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Key Adjustments:
- **balanceOfBatch**: Fixed the syntax error by ensuring the proper logical expression in the `forall` statement that checks within bounds and asserts the correct balance mapping.
- **safeTransferFrom**: Added a check to ensure the caller is authorized (either the sender is the operator or the operator has approval). This condition is based on checking the `_operatorApprovals`.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar adjustment for ensuring the caller's authorization via the operator checks. 

These annotations should adhere to the solc-verify syntax and correctly capture the intended behaviors specified by the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:43:19] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Corrections:
- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensured logical expression syntax in `forall` statements and checked lengths of the batch balances and input arrays to ensure conformity.
- **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom**: Clarified that `msg.sender` should be authorized either by being the `_from` address or having approval, and structured the logical statements correctly.
  
These annotations should now correctly convey the expected postconditions following the function executions, adhering to the ERC1155 standard semantics.

        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To address the errors and add appropriate postconditions using the solc-verify annotations for the ERC1155 contract, we'll ensure that the annotations are properly structured. Let's proceed by correctly annotating the functions to reflect their intended postconditions according to the ERC1155 standard:

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch**: Ensure the returned balances match the correct values stored in `_balances`.
- **setApprovalForAll and isApprovedForAll**: Ensure state changes or queries reflect correct status of approvals.
- **safeTransferFrom**: Verify the balance conditions before and after the transfer, ensuring the `_from` address has sufficient balance.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Ensure batch transfers respect the array matching and balance reduction conditions, ensuring balances don't drop below required amounts before initiating the transaction.

This structure ensures the correct functionality and adherence to expected outcomes per the ERC1155 standard.

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Annotated to ensure that the balance returned matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
  
- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensuring that the returned balance array corresponds correctly to the balance of each `(owner, id)` pair in the `_balances`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Records the approval status of operators so that actions taken by them are verified according to what's stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: The function's return reflects the state of approval in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Warranties for `_value` transfer are assured by ensuring the caller is approved and verifying the post-transfer balance state against old balances using `__verifier_old_uint`.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Validates batch operations by securing balance reductions are possible and reflect those in `_balances`. The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` arrays are checked for conformity.

These corrections ensure a consistent and accurate use of formal verification annotations aligned with the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:44:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Corrections:
- **Syntax Improvement**: Ensured proper usage of `forall` quantifier, consistent with annotations needed by `solc-verify`.
- **Balance Check**: Incorporated a balance condition for `safeTransferFrom` ensuring `__verifier_old_uint` is used to verify no underflows occur.
- **Batch Operations**: Correct handling of array lengths and value checks, assuring system integrity post-operations.
- **Authorization Verification**: Checked caller authorization using `_operatorApprovals`.

These adjustments make sure that the annotations align with the expected behavior specified by the ERC1155 standard, ensuring correctness and helping in formal verification of the solidity contract.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:45:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Provides a postcondition ensuring that the return value for the balance of a specified account `_owner` for a token `_id` matches the stored value in `_balances`.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures each `(owner, id)` pair in the input arrays corresponds directly with the balances returned, verifying lengths of arrays for consistency.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets the approval status for an operator given by `_operator` to manage all tokens of the caller. The postcondition ensures that `_operatorApprovals` reflects the `_approved` status.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms the return value reflects the presence of an approval in the mapping `_operatorApprovals`.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Checks the authorization via `_operatorApprovals` and ensures token balances are accounted for correctly before the transfer, handles self-transfers specially.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Contains checks for authorized transfers with correct length parity between `_ids` and `_values` arrays. Verifies that balances are sufficient before transactions, updating balances consistent with batch transfers, ensuring data integrity post-operation.

These annotated conditions help in setting up assertions and expectations for behavior planning within the smart contract's functions so they align with the ERC1155 standard for security and correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:45:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:
- **Postconditions**: Correctly structured with logical bounds and properties to ensure states are tracked accurately in alignment with the ERC1155 behaviors.
- **Authorization Check**: Explicit check that either the caller is the same as `_from` or they are approved as operators.
- **Balance Updates**: Use of `__verifier_old_uint` ensures reference to previous states for accurate balance checks and avoids underflow/overflow errors.
- **Array Length Matching**: Validating arrays' lengths, especially for `safeBatchTransferFrom`, reinforces correctness for operations that depend on corresponding array elements.

These detailed adjustments ensure the annotations are comprehensive, enforce the expected logic, and are syntactically correct for formal verification using `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:45:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Improvements:
- **Array Length Validity**: Ensure that the lengths of `_owners` and `_ids` match the `batchBalances` length for consistency in `balanceOfBatch`.
- **Authorization Check**: Verify that the caller is either the owner or approved operator (checked for both transfer functions).
- **Balance Check Before Transfer**: Ensures the balance reduction only occurs if sufficient funds are available in `_from` accounts.
- **Balance Update Logic**: Handle self-transfer and balance updates accurately with old state references using `__verifier_old_uint` for consistency.

These adjustments make sure that all function behaviors are documented with correct and logically sound postconditions.
