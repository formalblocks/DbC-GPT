    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points Covered in Annotations:
- **balanceOf**: This retrieves the balance of a specific token type for a given owner directly from `_balances`.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures consistency in the length of arrays, and verifies that the balance for each (owner, id) pair is directly related to `_balances`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates `_operatorApprovals` mapping upon successful call.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value for approval status of an `_operator` is consistent with the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

- **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom**: These include conditions to validate approval checks, non-zero address checks, balance sufficiency checks, and balance updates post-transfer for both single and batch transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:24:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points of Annotations:

- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Ensure that the returned balances correspond correctly to the current state by including equality conditions on `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**:
  - Adjust the operator approvals mapping accurately for `setApprovalForAll` and return the correct approval status for `isApprovedForAll`.

- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Confirm approval for transfers, non-zero `_to` address, and enforce balance checks.
  - Handle changes to balances correctly, with attention to self-transfer scenarios.

This spec now directly accounts for the behaviors of ERC-1155 token balances based on the action taken (transfer, approval) along with solidity formal verification conventions (e.g., old state conditions and success-false logic).

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:24:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: The annotations enforce that the returned balances directly map to the mapping values in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`** and **`isApprovedForAll`**: These functions ensure that the approval status is accurately reflected in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**: These annotations include checks for approval and sufficient balance. They also handle correct balance adjustments, ensuring they revert on any conditions that would lead to an incorrect state. The updated syntax keeps them expressively aligned with solc-verify requirements.

Each verification comment maintains alignment with state variables and addresses constraints like non-zero address requirements and appropriate balance changes consistent with ERC-1155 specifications.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:25:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Correction Highlights:
- Ensured all logical checks reflect exact mappings to state variables according to the latest state of the function caller.
- Used `forall` syntax correctly for iterating over lists.
- Respected the conditions disallowing transfer to the zero address and requiring sufficiency of balances for transfers.
- Confirmed that operator approval status is properly handled and check post-transfer balance adjustments appropriately.
- Implemented conditions to execute non-operationally (leave balances unchanged) on self-transfers.

        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:25:32] ===

### Explanation of Annotations:

- **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch**: Ensure the balance computed from the function matches the stored balance value.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Change in approval status should be reflected post-execution.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Response should directly reflect the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Check if the caller has the right to transfer on behalf of `_from`.
  - Ensure `_to` remains a non-zero address.
  - Enforce correct balance checks so conditions are met prior to balance updates.
  - Self-transfer (where `_from` is the same as `_to`) doesn't change balances; otherwise, balance updates happen accordingly.

These annotations should adhere to the solc-verify standard and align well with the ERC-1155 behavior as specified.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:25:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch**: Postcondition asserts that the values returned by these functions must match directly with what’s stored in `_balances` mapping.

- **setApprovalForAll and isApprovedForAll**: Ensure that the approval status is accurately stored and queried.

- **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Verify that the caller has the necessary approval.
  - Enforce that transfers do not occur to the zero address.
  - Ensure sufficient balance for all specified transfers.
  - Handle changes in balances correctly when `_from` does not equal `_to`.
  - Accommodate cases where tokens are transferred to the same address (`_from == _to`), leaving balances unchanged.

These annotations should be aligned with solc-verify requirements while capturing the expected behavior of ERC-1155.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:26:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:26:27] ===
To annotate each function with the correct postconditions, we need to ensure the postconditions reflect the expected behavior according to ERC-1155. I'll fix the syntax errors and correct any logical issues. Here’s how you should annotate the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

### Key Points:
- Annotations correctly express conditions and state changes as per the ERC-1155 specification requirements, ensuring that all safety, approval, balance, and conditional checks are verified.
- Used `forall` to iterate over array elements, making sure each element's condition is checked.
- Handled self-transfers by adding conditions that reflect unchanged balances in some areas. 

These annotations help ensure correctness and robustness by verifying key constraints and conditions the smart contract must adhere to.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:26:49] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Details:

- **`balanceOf`**: Confirms that the balance returned matches what is stored in the `_balances` mapping.
  
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Checks that the lengths of `_owners` and `_ids` match, and ensures each index in `batchBalances` accurately reflects balances in the `_balances` mapping.
  
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Verification of the change in approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms that the return value matches the approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensure sender approval and sufficient balance.
  - Prevent transfers to the zero address.
  - Update balances appropriately while handling self-transfer scenarios differently (balances remain the same).
  - Use `forall` to assert conditions for every element in arrays.

These postconditions succinctly encapsulate the functional guarantees and safety properties expected from an ERC-1155 compliant smart contract.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:27:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

- **View Functions**: Ensure that the return value matches the current state of the `_balances` mapping for each respective ID and owner.
- **Approval Functions**: Verify changes to the `_operatorApprovals` mapping to reflect the new approval state.
- **Transfer Functions**: Include conditions to verify sufficient balance, non-zero target addresses, permissions checks, and proper updates to balances for token holders when transfers are executed. Handle transfers correctly whether the sender is also the receiver or not.

By ensuring these verifications, the smart contract aims to adhere to standard behaviors while guarding against common pitfalls like sending to an invalid address or allowing unauthorized transfers.
