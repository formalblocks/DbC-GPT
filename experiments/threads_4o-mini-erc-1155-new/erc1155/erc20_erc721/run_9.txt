    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity

```

In these annotations:
- The `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` functions return the correct balance of tokens based on the internal `_balances` mapping.
- The `setApprovalForAll` function updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
- The `isApprovedForAll` function checks the approval status for an operator.
- The `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions ensure that balances are appropriately updated (decreased for `_from` and increased for `_to`) with checks against the old state and conditions in place (such as balance sufficiency and self-transfer handling). The `postcondition`s also handle cases where `_to` is not zero or both `_from` and `_to` addresses are the same, maintaining balances in the latter case.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:19:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:19:26] ===
To correct the errors and provide the formal verification annotations for the `ERC1155` contract, I'll ensure the postconditions properly reflect the logic of the functions. Specifically, I will correct and complete the annotations in accordance with the expected behavior of an ERC-1155 token interface. Here's how the annotations should be modified:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    */
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length && _owners.length == _ids.length
        @notice postcondition forall (uint i) batchBalances[i] == _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]
    */
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /**
        @notice postcondition (_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved && _operator != address(0))
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**
        @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**
        @notice postcondition ( (_balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value && _from != _to)
                               || (_balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) && _from == _to) )
        @notice postcondition ( (_balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value && _from != _to)
                               || (_balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) && _from == _to) )
        @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_from] >= _value || _from == msg.sender
    */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**
        @notice postcondition _ids.length == _values.length
        @notice postcondition forall (uint i) _balances[_ids[i]][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i] || _from == msg.sender
        @notice postcondition forall (uint i) (_balances[_ids[i]][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_balances[_ids[i]][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) && _from == _to)
    */
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Notable Changes:
- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:** Annotations ensure the function's return values directly relate to the current state of `_balances`.
- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Changed the condition to relate to the `_operatorApprovals` state variable, ensuring the operator approval status is recorded correctly.
- **`isApprovedForAll`:** Reflects the return value ties directly to the `_operatorApprovals` mapping status.
- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Postconditions ensure the correct update of balances within the constraints of self-transfers, and value sufficiency, ensuring the transfer can only happen if approved and balances are sufficient.

These changes follow the ERC-1155 standard requirements accurately and should remove solvência verification errors.

Let's address the identified errors by refining the annotations and ensuring that the postconditions correctly describe the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard. I will adjust the conditions slightly to tackle potential logical issues, considering possible states and transitions as highlighted by your description.

    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);

### Explanation
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensured that `batchBalances` has the same length as `_owners` and `_ids`; included all requisite postconditions.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Controls the approval state directly within `_operatorApprovals` and no unnecessary address check since approval function conforms to standard by allowing zero-address rejection elsewhere.
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Checks for length equality; ensured balance sufficiency before deductions in line with ERC-1155 requirements; captured balance changes via proper key transitions.

By aligning these conditions more specifically to the contract's anticipated flow, execution will conform more closely to the contract's expected post-state while addressing underlying logical gaps previously noted by compile-time feedback in formal verifications.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:20:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the verification issues and ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard, it's important to consider the constraints and logic involved in the safe batch transfer function, as well as ensure that the batch balance retrieval function's annotations reflect unforeseen conditions. Let’s proceed with refined annotations:

```solidity

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);

```

### Adjustments Made:
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensured the batch balances relate explicitly to the internal mappings, aligning with each positional `(owner, id)` pair.
  
- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Checked the value against `__verifier_old_uint` state for balance sufficiency explicitly.
  - Ensured the conditions accurately reflect variations in behavior when the sender and recipient are the same.
  - Underlined the equality of the ids and values arrays length before performing further operations.
  - Added consistency in expressing balance transitions for both address balances, capturing transfer conditions for both `_from` and `_to` across looped processing of batch transfers.

The postconditions ensure that the logic holds across different iterations of operations, allowing formal tools to verify correctness for a broad spectrum of potential uses.

### Key Adjustments:
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensured that each element in `batchBalances` matches with `_balances` for each paired index of `_owners` and `_ids`. This reflects that joint indexing matters, maintaining the mapping's consistency.
  
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Verified that the length of `_ids` and `_values` arrays match.
  - Assured each `value` in `_values` is less than or equal to the pre-transfer `_from` balance.
  - Corrected balance decrement and increment logics with respect to preconditions, addressing both usual and self-transfer pathways.
  
These conditions closely align the operations with the defined behaviors in the ERC-1155 standard while catering to variations introduced within batch operations.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:21:25] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:21:30] ===
To address the issues cited by solc-verify, we need to refine the annotations to adhere to the correct syntax, especially for loop-based conditions. Additionally, I'll ensure that all postconditions are logically sound and reflect the intended operation of the ERC-1155 standard. I will use the correct quantifier setup without errors and improve annotation clarity. Here’s the corrected contract with formal verification annotations added:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

### Key Changes:
- **`forall` Syntax for Quantified Expressions**: Correctly specified the loop syntax for `forall` conditions. Note that `i` is iterating over the range of `ids.length`.
- **Logic Correction**: Checks for both pre-decrement and post-increment balances straightforwardly using old state variables.
- **Array Length Checks**: Ensures conformity of `_ids` and `_values` arrays, reinforcing order consistency.
- **Balance Sufficient Check**: Ensures that each corresponding balance is adequate before funds deduction, a vital validation step pre-operation.

These changes respect the original intention behind ERC-1155 functionality while ensuring semantic and syntactic correctness needed for formal verification processes.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:21:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Corrections:

- **Correct Syntax for `forall`:** Ensure proper syntax with the condition `(i < _ids.length)` to correctly link to valid indices and apply the postcondition for each valid index.
- **Ensured Array Length Consistency:** Added checks to ensure `_ids` and `_values` arrays are consistent for operation across batch transfers.
- **Balance Consistency:** Each balance ensures that decrements and increments are carefully maintaining correct behavior, including handling scenarios for self-transfer.
- **Quantified Expressions:** Properly applied to batch operations.

These corrections improve the accuracy of the conditions relative to expectations and ensure compliance with the ERC-1155 standards for smart contracts.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:22:11] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Corrections:

- **Correct Use of `forall`:** Ensured that `forall` condition checks iterate over a valid range represented by `i < length` style condition within the expression, thus achieving correct comprehension over element indices.
  
- **Syntactic Accuracy:** Fixed prior issues in logical expressions to align with what `solc-verify` requires for solid verification of behaviors.

These changes should rectify any syntax-related errors and ensure alignment with the intended outcome as per the ERC-1155 specification.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:22:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:
- **Correct Syntax for `forall`:** Ensured each `forall` is related correctly to valid indices using `i < length`.
  
- **Logical Expressions:** Refined the logic conditions for pre and post-operation verification which depends on whether `_from` equals `_to`, aligning inspection for correct balance impacts before and after operations.

These adjustments correct the prior syntactical errors, ensuring meaningful verification for this contract's operations as prescribed by the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:22:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To resolve the issues with annotations for verification using `solc-verify`, we must ensure the quantified expressions are correctly formatted. The `forall` quantifier should correctly reference the scope of each variable, ensuring all logical expressions are valid. Here’s how you can correct the annotations for your ERC1155 contract functions:

```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals

### Key Adjustments:
- **Using the Correct Range Syntax:** The syntax `i in 0...array.length` was used to accurately iterate over the correct range, assuming this or a similar syntax reflects solc-verify-compatible iteration.
  
- **Logical Relationship:** The conditions maintain consistent state handling between pre and post transfer values ensuring balance invariance for self-transfers and ensuring batch operations fulfill required constraints.

This should ensure that the smart contract complies with the ERC-1155 standard while functioning properly with the solc-verify tool for formal verification.
