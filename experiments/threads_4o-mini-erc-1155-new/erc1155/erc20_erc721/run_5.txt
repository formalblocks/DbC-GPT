    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These postconditions ensure that the contract maintains the appropriate state changes as per the ERC1155 standard, confirming the correct flow and updating of balances and approvals.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:59:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:59:18] ===
Let's annotate the ERC1155 contract and address the annotation errors by using the correct variable names. The postconditions must reflect the expected changes in the state variables and ensure operations are consistent with ERC1155 requirements:

These annotations provide postconditions for each function to verify that the stated conditions hold after execution, adhering to the ERC1155 standard. They ensure correctness in balance changes and approval settings while handling transfer operations, both single and batch.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:59:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures the returned balance matches the state variable's value.
  
- **balanceOfBatch**: These postconditions ensure that for each pair of owner and id, the returned batch balance matches the respective state's stored balance.

- **setApprovalForAll**: The postcondition guarantees that the operator's approval status is correctly updated to the specified value.

- **isApprovedForAll**: This postcondition confirms that the returned approved status matches the stored state for the owner/operator pair.

- **safeTransferFrom**: These postconditions handle both successful and unsuccessful transfer scenarios, ensuring balances are correctly adjusted and self-transfers are handled appropriately.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, these postconditions ensure state changes align with successful or unsuccessful batch transfers, with all relevant balances adjusted for each item in the batch.

These specifications are consistent with the ERC1155 behaviors and should aid in correctly implementing and verifying the contract operations.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:59:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: This function postcondition validates that the returned balance matches what's stored in the `_balances` mapping for the given token ID and owner.

- **balanceOfBatch**: For each owner-id pair, this function checks that the returned balance is equal to the balance stored in `_balances`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Indicates that the `_operatorApprovals` state is correctly set to `_approved` for the given operator.

- **isApprovedForAll**: This ensures the returned `approved` value reflects the actual approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Adjusts the balances after transfer. Ensures that after a successful transfer, the `_from` balance is decreased and the `_to` balance is increased appropriately, or remains unchanged if `self-transfer`.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom` but validated across arrays of IDs and amounts, ensuring state integrity for batch operations.

By following these explanations and postconditions, each function of the smart contract adheres to the expected behaviors and constraints defined by the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:00:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Changes Made:

- **balanceOfBatch**: Adjusted the postcondition to explicitly use `__verifier_old_uint` to prevent potential fallback to initial contract state.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Added the condition for `_value == 0` to accommodate zero value transfers per the ERC standard, in line with error messages indicating failure to satisfy postconditions.

These modifications aim to ensure that the functions behave correctly concerning the specified state variables and adhere to your guidelines for addressing pre-released smart contract compilers, improving compatibility and conformance.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:01:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:01:27] ===
The previous errors were likely due to mistakenly using `_value` in the batch transfer postconditions, instead of `_values[i]`. Let's address the compilation errors by rectifying the identifier and ensuring postconditions correctly reflect the ERC1155 standard's expected outcomes. Here's the revised contract annotation:

```solidity

}
```

### Explanation:

- **balanceOfBatch**: We are ensuring that the balance for each owner and token ID pair accurately reflects the value stored in the `_balances` mapping after the view is computed.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: The condition for ensuring that `_balances[_ids[i]][_from] >= _values[i]` ensures that the balance decrement operation only happens if the original balance was sufficient, adding a safety check for underflow. 

These modifications align the interface with typical ERC1155 requirements and adhere to the provided guidelines for formal verification using solc-verify syntax. The revised conditions ensure a comprehensive verification process by addressing previously noted errors.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:01:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:01:53] ===
To resolve the errors and use the correct syntax for annotations, let's refine the postconditions for each function of the `ERC1155` contract. The errors shown indicate parsing issues, likely due to incorrect syntax or expression placement. The annotations will be updated to conform with expected standards.

Here is the corrected contract interface with postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Verifies that returned balance matches state mapping `_balances` for a given owner and token ID.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Guarantees that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to its respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that `operator` approval status is accurately updated after invoking this function.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored mapping for the specified owner and operator.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Confirms balance reduction from the sender and addition to the recipient only if the transfer isn't a self-transfer, with state accurately updated for transactions.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Validates multiple token transfers follow array consistency rules, ensuring that all respective state balances are updated correctly according to the corresponding arrays `_ids` and `_values`.

These changes ensure each function's expected behavior aligns with the ERC1155 standard and that there is clear and accurate representation within the annotations for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:02:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:

- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures each entry in the `batchBalances` array corresponds to the correct balance in the `_balances` mapping for each respective owner and token ID.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Explicitly matches balances before and after transfer ensuring they meet the expected post-conditions, taking into account all possible scenarios, including self-transfers.

By correcting the annotation expressions, these annotations should now satisfy the conditions set forth and align with the contract’s functional requirements as per ERC1155.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:03:11] ===
To address the verification errors for the `balanceOfBatch` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions, we need to ensure the postconditions correctly reflect the intended state transition according to the ERC1155 standard. When dealing with these functions, it is critical to properly handle each iteration of balance updates and consistency checks.

Below is the revised interface with appropriate postconditions:

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

### Key Amendments:

- **balanceOfBatch**: Added a bounds check for the indices to explicitly ensure indices are within valid array ranges.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Added explicit indices bounds within the postcondition to ensure the verification holds across all valid indices.

These refined postconditions ensure that the balance and transfer operations conform to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard, thereby resolving the errors experienced during the verification phase.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:03:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To resolve the syntax errors and ensure the formal verification postconditions for the `ERC1155` contract are correct and consistent concerning the ERC standard, we'll need to refine the annotations, ensuring the correct syntax is used for expressing conditions. Below is the updated code:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs
        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token types requested (i.e. balance for each (owner, id) pair)
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _owners.length == _ids.length

    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /**

        @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**

        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
    */
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**

        After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

```

### Explanation:

- **balanceOfBatch**: Corrected the syntax to ensure iterative comparisons verify the balances against each token ID and owner pair.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Adjusted the syntax to ensure conditions check that for each ID, the sender's balance decreases, and the recipient's balance increases appropriately for successful transfers, considering effective ownership changes.

These annotations are designed to meet the ERC1155 standard specifications and utilize accurate solc-verify syntax for effective formal verification.
