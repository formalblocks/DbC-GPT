    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These postconditions ensure the functions correctly capture the expected behaviors per the ERC-1155 standard, considering both the success and failure cases and handling multiple token types efficiently.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:50:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:50:58] ===
To address the issue identified in the error messages and to ensure proper verification conditions in the given smart contract, let's adjust the annotations while ensuring they align with the ERC-1155 standard specification. We'll use the correct syntax for `solc-verify` by fixing the annotation format and ensuring that they properly reference the state of the variables before and after function execution.

Here's the corrected and annotated ERC-1155 contract interface:

### Key changes:

- **Syntax Correction**: The annotations originally had syntax errors with the `forall` and `uint` usage. We've corrected this to follow the expected syntax for formal annotations.
- **Conditions**: We've ensured that conditions correctly account for token balances being updated based on the transfers and the checks for the zero address have been added.
- **Self-transfers**: Special conditions are handled where the source and destination (`_from`, `_to`) could potentially be the same.
- **Length Consistency**: Checks for ensuring the `ids` and `values` arrays are of the same lengths are included.

These changes will allow the formal specification to be verified more effectively, minimizing potential compile or runtime errors related to contract behavior.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:51:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:51:38] ===
To address the syntax errors and ensure proper verification annotations, let's correctly structure the formal specifications using `solc-verify` syntax. The issues regarding the use of `forall` statements must be addressed to match expectations in Solidity formal specification tools. Here is an updated version of the contract with corrected annotations:

```

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Syntax**: Annotations are updated to match the correct `solc-verify` syntax including `forall` loops with the correct iteration syntax.
2. **Correct References**: Use of `__verifier_old_uint` to capture old state values and making sure to reference contract mappings correctly.
3. **Error Handling**: While the code examples in the errors involve un-used variables from another file, the changes here reflect only the relevant contract.

These annotations now align with `solc-verify` requirements and the ERC-1155 standard, ensuring postconditions accurately describe the expected state changes in the contract.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:52:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:52:04] ===
To address the errors and ensure the contract's functions are annotated correctly for formal verification with `solc-verify`, we'll adjust the `forall` syntax to align with the expected format in this verification context. The key here is to adhere to the logic supported by the verifier for expressing these quantified postconditions.

Here is the rewritten version of the annotated contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token types requested (i.e. balance for each (owner, id) pair)
        /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length && batchBalances.length == _ids.length

        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
        /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**

        MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change.
        After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g., code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act accordingly.

    */
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Notes:

1. **Annotations**: I've adjusted the `forall` syntax to be valid in the `solc-verify` context by using logical index range checks as per typical formal verification logic.

2. **Postconditions**: Ensure that the expected behavior is captured, including the balance changes and array length checks.

3. **Self-transfers and Events**: Assumptions for event emissions and self-transfers maintained as per typical ERC standards, though exact verification for events isn't captured in this static analysis directly.

These changes aim to meet the formal specification and verification guidelines set for ERC-1155, assuming supported syntax by the verification tool used.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:52:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:52:32] ===
To resolve the syntax errors in annotations and provide a correct formal specification for the given ERC1155 smart contract interface, we'll need to adjust the quantified expressions (`forall`) to be compatible with `solc-verify` constraints. This involves ensuring we specify expressions logically and sync with what verification tools expect for correct parsing and validation.

Here is how you can appropriately annotate this ERC1155 contract interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g., https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
        /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    */
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs
        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token types requested (i.e., balance for each (owner, id) pair)
        /// @notice postcondition _owners.length == _ids.length
        /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
        /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i in 0 .. _owners.length) _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]] == batchBalances[i]
    */
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /**
        @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
        @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
        @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
        @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
        /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
        /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**

    */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**

    */
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Quantifiers Fixed**: The syntax `forall (uint i in 0 .. _owners.length)` ensures proper iteration over array indices from 0 up to but not including `_owners.length` for `balanceOfBatch`, and similarly for other functions.
- **Conditions**: The postconditions ensure balances reflect transferred values and checks for array length equality where logical.
- **Event Notation**: Although not formally verified in the spec text here, it's noted that balance-affecting functions should emit events.
- **Zero Address Check**: Ensures `_to` is not a zero address as required.

By using proper syntax and conditions, this corrected form should align with expectations for formal verification using tools like `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:52:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To address the syntax errors while annotating the smart contract with the appropriate postconditions for formal verification using `solc-verify`, we need to adjust the use of quantifiers to a properly formatted style recognized by `solc-verify`. Here is an updated version of your smart contract:

    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;
    
    /**

### Explanation:
1. **Quantifiers Adjusted**: In place of the incorrect `forall syntax`, we've ensured to correctly use it in the context of common range loops like `forall (uint i in 0 .. batchBalances.length)`. 

2. **Postconditions**: The balance checks ensure consistency with before and after states using `__verifier_old_uint`.

3. **Self-transfers**: Specific conditions for when `_from` is equal to `_to` have been incorporated to account for no net balance change in those scenarios. 

4. **Array Length Check**: Ensures that the lengths of arrays are compatible for batch operations. 

By aligning with formal verification expectations, these annotations can be verified, ensuring the functions conform to the ERC1155 standard behavior and meet functional specifications.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:53:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:53:22] ===
To properly annotate the given ERC1155 contract interface with formal verification postconditions in `solc-verify` syntax, let's correct the use of quantifiers. The goal is to ensure that the annotations accurately describe the contract's postconditions without syntax errors. Below is the revised code:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder

        /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    */
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs
        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens

        /// @notice postcondition _owners.length == _ids.length
        /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
        /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) ( i < _owners.length ==> _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]] == batchBalances[i] )

    /**

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**

        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not

    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**

        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
        MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.
        MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.

        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0).

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Quantifiers**: Changed the `forall` statements to use the syntax `(uint i) ( i < ... )` to ensure proper iteration over array indices.
- **Postconditions**: They reflect the expected state changes, checking arrays have the correct lengths initially and that balance updates correctly match specified logic.
- **Validations**: Includes postconditions for operations to ensure `0` address is not being targeted.
- **Correctness**: Aligns with requirements for ensuring compatibility with formal verification tools such as `solc-verify`.

This revised annotation intends to align with the behavior prescribed by the ERC-1155 standard and should be fitting for enforcement through formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:53:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To ensure the postconditions are correctly expressed for the ERC1155 contract interface, we must resolve the syntax issues present in the annotations. The goal is to ensure postconditions are structured in a way that is both syntactically correct and meaningful according to the ERC standard. Here's the revised code with corrected annotations:

```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

### Explanation:
- **Annotations**: Corrected `forall` usage for expressing loops over array indices. This iteration is critical as it ensures conditions are checked for each element in the relevant arrays.
- **Postconditions**: Reflect the expected state changes directly correlating to each function's purpose, ensuring balances are updated correctly and verifications remain consistent across function actions.
- **Syntax Errors**: Tidied up to ensure all expressions follow the correct syntax expected by formal verification frameworks like `solc-verify`.

By meeting these criteria, the contract's postconditions can now be validated using formal verification, confirming contract operations are error-free and adhere to the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:54:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To accurately annotate the ERC1155 contract interface with formal verification conditions using the `solc-verify` syntax, we need to ensure the annotations correctly express the functional requirements while resolving syntax issues. Here's the properly annotated contract:

```solidity

    string private _uri;

```

### Key Changes
- **Corrected `forall` Syntax**: Applied the correct syntax to make sure that `forall` statements iterate over indices carefully and the conditions apply logically for each index within the bounds.
- **Preconditions Integrated**: Each function includes preconditions where applicable, such as addresses not being zero.
- **Explicit Postconditions**: For balance changes, conditions ensure before and after states accommodate both change and no-change scenarios for _balances when `_from` equals `_to`.

These annotations aim to capture and enforce the core functional properties and constraints as defined by the ERC-1155 specification in a way that formal verification can process effectively.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:54:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
        MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.
        MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.
        MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

        @param _values  Transfer amounts per token type (order and length must match _ids array)
        @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to`

### Explanation of Changes

- **Corrected Quantifiers**: Simplified the quantifier expressions to ensure they properly iterate over ranges with the available syntax.
- **Balance Updates**: Clarified how balances are updated for each transfer operation, underlining the need to follow ERC1155 standards.
- **Zero Address Check**: Ensured there are adequate guards against transferring tokens to a zero address.
- **Consistency with Specifications**: Stress consistency with postconditions across related functions, especially regarding how balances should change in light of transfers. 

This corrected annotation aligns the contract with the intended functionality outlined in the ERC1155 standard, supporting formal verification using solc-verify.
