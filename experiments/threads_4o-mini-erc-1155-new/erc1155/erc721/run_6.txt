=== USER [2025-04-17 03:55:42] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This specification uses postconditions to formally describe the expected state changes and conditions for each function based on the ERC1155 standard. These annotations should help in formally verifying the correctness of implementations of this interface.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:56:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Postconditions Explanation

1. **`balanceOf`:** Ensure that the balance returned by `balanceOf` matches the stored balance in `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner address.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`:** This checks that the length of the returned balances array matches the length of the input owner IDs and token IDs. Also, it ensures that each owner’s balance retrieved corresponds to the balance stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`:** The mapping `_operatorApprovals` for the sender and operator must reflect the approval status set by `_approved`. Emission of the `ApprovalForAll` event is mandatory.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`:** Indicates the approval status through the `_operatorApprovals` mapping must return and match the `approved` status for given `_owner` and `_operator`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`:** Ensures post-transfer balances match expected changes due to the transfer (decreased for `_from` and increased for `_to` by `_value`). Emission of the `TransferSingle` event is recorded upon successful execution of the function. Conditions are specified for success operations.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Verifies that transfer conducts correctly according to sequences within the order specified in arrays. Ensures both the constraints for matched array lengths and that balances after operation reflect the transactions. It should emit events (`TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch`) to reflect such transfers.

These postconditions help ensure consistency with ERC1155 requirements, offer a formal verification to the state changes, and describe the contract operations' expected behaviors.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:56:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Postconditions Explanation

1. **`balanceOf`:** Ensure the return of `balanceOf` accurately reflects the stored balance in `_balances` for the specified token ID and `_owner`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`:** Check that the length of the returned balances array is identical to the input `_owners` and `_ids`, and confirm each owner's balance matches the balances stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`:** The `_operatorApprovals` mapping should reflect the approval status set by `_approved` for the caller and the specified operator. Emission of the `ApprovalForAll` event is also verified.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`:** Return must match the `_operatorApprovals` mapping's stored approval status for the specified `_owner` and `_operator`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`:** Updates the `_balances` mapping to reflect correct debiting from `_from` and crediting to `_to` by `_value`. Takes into account self-transfers. Emission of the `TransferSingle` event upon success is ensured.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Ensures the operation reflects correct debiting from `_from` and crediting to `_to` for each token type in `_ids`. It verifies that both arrays `_ids` and `_values` are equal in length. It checks that changes in states of balances match the transfers as intended in the relevant mappings and confirms the emission of `TransferBatch` for batched tokens.

These annotations provide a formal specification of the contract's intended behavior, aiming at increasing the correctness and reliability of the code.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:57:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf`:** The balance of a specific owner and token ID should exactly match the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`:** Asserts that the return array `batchBalances` mirrors the result of querying each balance in `_balances` for each provided (owner, ID) pair, ensuring the lengths of owners and IDs match.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`:** When called, sets or revokes approval for an `_operator` to manage the caller's tokens and reflects this in the `_operatorApprovals` map. The `ApprovalForAll` event must be emitted.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`:** Reflects the approval status (true or false) recorded in the `_operatorApprovals` map for the corresponding `_owner` and `_operator`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`:** Ensures that an amount `_value` of a token ID `_id` is correctly debited from the `_from's` balance and credited to the `_to's` balance, while not affecting balances for self-transfers. Emission of a `TransferSingle` event is required.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Confirms the transfer of multiple tokens, ensuring tokens of type `_ids` are sent from `_from` to `_to`. Reflects the necessary balance updates, verifies array length agreement, and requires a `TransferBatch` event emission.

These annotations help guide formal verification tools to assert correct behavior as specified in the ERC1155 standard and are crucial for thorough testing and contract verification.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:57:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Postconditions Explanation

1. **`balanceOf`:** The postcondition asserts that the `balance` returned by the `balanceOf` function is exactly what is stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`:** Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the lengths of the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays. For each owner-token pair, the balance in `batchBalances` array accurately reflects the balance stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`:** Sets the approved status for an operator. Reflects the changes in `_operatorApprovals` and requires that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted when called.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`:** Confirms that the function return matches the approval status in `_operatorApprovals` for the specified `_owner` and `_operator`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`:** Postconditions ensure that `_value` tokens of `_id` are accurately debited from `_from` (unless `_from == _to`, in which case it is a self-transfer), and credited to `_to`. The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted to record this operation.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Ensures that a batch transfer accurately reflects changes in balances for each token ID according to `_ids` and `_values`. Asserts equal lengths for `_ids` and `_values`, and requires the `TransferBatch` event emission to log all balance changes.

These postconditions are designed to facilitate formal verification by asserting that the smart contract operates correctly per the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:57:49] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf`:** Verifies that the balance returned matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`:** Ensures the resulting array `batchBalances` contains balances that align with those stored in `_balances` for each pair of owner and ID, and verifies array lengths consistency.

- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Confirms the operator's approval status in `_operatorApprovals` is updated and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

- **`isApprovedForAll`:** Checks that the result matches the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** Ensures correct balance updates for `_from` and `_to` after a transfer, considering a self-transfer case where `_from == _to`. Ensures the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Confirms that balance changes for each token type adhere to `_ids` and `_values`, with equal lengths. Each batch transfer triggers a `TransferBatch` event, and this function checks conditions like array length and balance sufficiency before conducting transfers. 

These postconditions assure compliance with the ERC1155 standard and support formal verification of the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:58:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf`:** Ensures the returned `balance` is equal to the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`:** Asserts correct mappings and lengths: ensures `batchBalances` contains balances in the same order as `_owners` and `_ids`, verifying consistent lengths.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`:** Reflects the change in approval status within `_operatorApprovals` and ensures the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`:** Confirms that the returned `approved` value matches the stored approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.
   
5. **`safeTransferFrom`:** Checks balance changes due to `_value` transfer, considering self-transfers where `_from == _to`. Requires the `TransferSingle` event emission for successful balance changes.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Validates transfer mechanics in bulk, ensuring balance updates occur according to `_ids` and `_values`. Asserts length equality and event logging via `TransferBatch`.

These annotations serve as formal specifications to reinforce correctness and compliance with the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:58:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf`:** Ensures the `balance` returned is equal to the `_balances` mapping value for the specific token `_id` and owner `_owner`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`:** Confirms that each pair of (_id, _owner) entries in its argument arrays are processed to get their balances and that the length of `batchBalances` is equal to `_owners` and `_ids`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Indicates that `_operatorApprovals` should reflect the newly set status for the specified operator and ensure the `ApprovalForAll` event emission.

- **`isApprovedForAll`:** Checks if the returned `approved` status matches what is stored in `_operatorApprovals` for [_owner][_operator].

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** Validates movement of tokens by updating balances appropriately and ensuring `TransferSingle` event generation.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Ensures batch transfers handle each respective `(_ids[x], _values[x])` set, requiring the `TransferBatch` event to capture the batched nature of the operation.

These conditions aim to guarantee that operations align with the ERC1155 specification, supporting formal verification of intended behaviors.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:58:57] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

1. **`balanceOf`:** Checks that the `balance` returned equals the stored balance for the specified owner and ID in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`:** Ensures that `batchBalances` corresponds exactly to the balances of the tuples of owners and IDs, asserting equal lengths.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`:** Confirms the modification of `_operatorApprovals` reflects the new approval status, and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`:** This ensures that the result 'approved' directly corresponds to the status in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`:** Handles token transfer for a single item. It ensures post-transfer balances reflect deductions and additions accordingly without affecting balances for self-transfers (`_from == _to`). The event `TransferSingle` captures the transaction.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Manages batch transfers across arrays and verifies the consistency of balances effectively, requiring appropriate event logging via `TransferBatch`, maintaining order and structure per the standard's rules.

These annotations are designed to assist in verifying the correctness of ERC1155 implementations and ensure compliance with the standard's requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:59:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf`:** Postcondition confirms that the returned balance corresponds to the stored `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`:** Ensures `batchBalances` size matches input arrays and verifies that each entry aligns with their respective balances in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`:** This confirms that the `_operatorApprovals` state variable reflects the change made by the function call, and ensures the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

- **`isApprovedForAll`:** Ensures the return value `approved` accurately reflects the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** Verifies that balances update correctly for a single token transfer, considering self-transfers where no balance change occurs. Ensures the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match, and ensures that each transfer updates the balances correctly, considering self-transfers. Logs actions with the `TransferBatch` event.

These formal specifications aim to confirm adherence to the ERC1155 standard and facilitate formal verification of the contract implementation.
