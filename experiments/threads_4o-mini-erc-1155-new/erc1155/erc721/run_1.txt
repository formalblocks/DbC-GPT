    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To accurately represent the behavior of the ERC1155 functions according to the EIP-1155 standard, I will now provide annotations using the `solc-verify` syntax. These annotations will include appropriate postconditions that reflect the expected behaviors of each function as outlined in the ERC1155 standards, while ensuring consistent use of state variables and function parameters.

These annotations accurately convey the behavior as specified by the ERC1155 standard, providing a basis for formal verification of the contract's functions.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:36:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To annotate the ERC1155 smart contract interface with formal verification conditions using `solc-verify`, we need to address the issues highlighted in your output, such as missing keywords in the annotations and ensuring correct usage of the solc-verify syntax.

### Explanation
1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the returned `balance` corresponds correctly to the state mapping `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that the lengths of `_owners` and `_ids` are the same, returned array `batchBalances` is the same length as the input arrays, and each balance correctly represents `_balances` at that index.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Verifies that the operator approval status is set correctly.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the function return value `approved` is aligned with `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: Asserts that no transfer occurs if `_to` is the zero address, updates balances of `_from` and `_to` correctly, and considers self-transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Maintains the condition that `_to` is not a zero address, the length of `_ids` matches `_values`, and iterates over `_ids` and `_values` to check balance changes, considering both the balance deduction from `_from` and addition to `_to`.

These annotations should help the verification process by capturing the expected behaviors that align with the ERC1155 specification and handle possible input conditions.

        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Fixes:
- **forall Syntax**: Corrected the `forall` syntax to use initialization, condition, and iteration within the loop as `forall (uint i = 0; i < n; i++)` which is a proper format for annotations.
- Consistent with the formal verification guidelines, ensuring adequate checks and appropriate updates for address and balance conditions.

The conditions are consistent with standard ERC behavior requests and the correct usage of state variables and function parameters provided in the contract interface.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:37:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

### Key Fixes:
- **Syntax Correction**: Fixed the syntax of `forall (uint i; ...)` to be consistent with the expected syntax and semantic of the tool, ensuring we use parentheses and semicolons properly.
- **Logical Conditions**: Ensures logical expressions such as balance calculations account for potential self-transfers (`_from == _to`), and that array lengths match as expected.
  
These adjustments should help the annotations match the formal verification requirements expected by `solc-verify`, assuming the rest of the context surrounding its usage is correct. The correct parsing of annotations should now reflect proper behavior and relationships in accordance with the ERC1155 specification.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:38:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Corrections:
1. **`forall` Syntax**: Changed the `forall` syntax to use commas instead of semicolons for the conditions, which is the proper format for `solc-verify`.

2. **Array Length Conditions**: Added checks to ensure the length of input arrays matches those expected, which aligns with the standard's requirement.

3. **Balance Changes**: Ensured that balance changes are calculated considering both normal transfers and self-transfers (`_from == _to`). This handles the possibility of transferring tokens to oneself correctly.

These modifications should fix the parsing errors, allowing the `solc-verify` tool to check the contract functions' correctness against the specified conditions.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:38:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 03:38:29] ===
Let's address the issue with the `forall` syntax within the annotations for your ERC1155 smart contract interface. The `solc-verify` tool expects a specific structure for `forall` loops which can be different from typical programming loops seen in languages like C++ or Java. Below is the proper specification for the smart contract with correctly formatted `solc-verify` annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

    */

### Key Fixes:
1. **`forall` Syntax**: Corrected the use of `forall` to fit the syntax expected by `solc-verify`, where you iteratively assert conditions over indexed elements with `forall(uint i) condition`, using a proper logic constraint (`_ids.length > i`) to bound loops.

2. **Logical Conditions**: Assertions correctly use logical operations to specify how state variables change pre-and post-conditions, considering both typical cases and self-transfers.

3. **Invariant Preservation**: Ensures the correct relationship between function inputs and state variable changes, thus preserving ERC1155 invariants.

These annotations, with corrections, should be valid for `solc-verify` and correctly reflect the ERC1155 standard, covering both single and batch transfers, balance queries, and operator approvals.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:38:48] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 03:38:51] ===
The `solc-verify` verification language requires correct parsing of annotations, particularly the use of the `forall` keyword for specifying conditions over arrays. Let's address the errors in your output by correcting the expression formatting. I'll provide appropriate annotations for each function in your ERC1155 smart contract based on the ERC specification and formal verification guidelines.

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

### Explanation
1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: Ensure that return values directly reflect data from the `_balances` mapping.

2. **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Ensure that the approval status in `_operatorApprovals` is set and queried correctly based on function parameters.

3. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Postconditions ensure:
   - The `_to` address cannot be zero.
   - Balances are adjusted according to the transfer amount, accounting for potential self-transfers where `_from == _to`.

4. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Postconditions ensure:
   - The `_to` address cannot be zero.
   - The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Balances for all `ids` are adjusted according to the respective values in `_values`, accounting for potential self-transfers.

These adjustments address previous parsing errors by fixing loop syntax issues and leveraging clear logic for asset transfers, enhancing compatibility with ERC1155's standard behavior and `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:39:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 03:39:12] ===
To address the syntax errors with the `forall` statements in the postconditions and ensure accurate postcondition annotations, let's correct the syntax for defining the loop within `solc-verify` annotations. We should use parentheses properly, consisting of bounds conditions (`i`) and ensure we're consistent with state variables. Here is your ERC1155 contract with the annotations correctly specified:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

    /**

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Postcondition Logic**: Each function with a formal postcondition ensures that the behaviors described (such as non-zero addresses, correct balance updates) are adhered to, using the correct logical format.
  
2. **Use of `success`**: For functions returning a boolean, handle both success and failure according to the standard practices, ensuring that the transfer conditions are consistently valid for both outcomes.

3. **`forall` Loop**: Proper syntax uses `forall(uint i; condition)`, with correctly bounded position and use of scopes for iterating over the array indices.

The corrected annotations should help the contract's functions match their expected behaviors regarding balances, transfers, and operational approvals, conforming to the ERC1155 standards and addressing valid syntax for `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:39:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 03:39:42] ===
To properly annotate the ERC1155 smart contract interface with `solc-verify` postconditions that adhere to the ERC standard and verification guidelines, we'll fix the annotations provided in your example:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g., https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

    /**

    */

### Key Points:
- **Loop Syntax**: The `forall` syntax has been corrected to separate index declaration and conditions with a semicolon: `forall (uint i; 0 <= i && i < _length)`.
- **Transfer Conditions**: Properly handle both transfer cases and self-transfers, ensuring no change to balances in the latter.
- **State Matching**: Ensures the `balanceOf` and other view functions directly reflect the underlying mappings.
- **Account Restrictions**: Incorporate `_to != address(0)` in transfer functions to handle only valid addresses.

These corrections ensure compliance with the ERC1155 standard and leverage `solc-verify` to check and validate the transfer and approval logic in the smart contract.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:40:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To correctly annotate the ERC1155 smart contract with `solc-verify` postconditions that adhere to the ERC1155 standard, we need to ensure the syntax for `forall` and other expressions are properly formatted. Let's refine the postconditions in the contract based on specifications and the guidelines provided:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g., https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs
        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token types requested (i.e., balance for each (owner, id) pair)
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _owners.length == _ids.length
    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i; 0 <= i && i < _owners.length) batchBalances[i] == _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /**
        @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
        @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
        @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
        @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
    */
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**
        @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).

        MUST revert on any other error.
        MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g., code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

    /**

### Key Annotations and Conditions:

1. **Balance Functions** (`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`):
   - Return values directly reflect the `_balances` data.

2. **Operator Approval Functions** (`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`):
   - These functions confirm the management settings of operators for given addresses.

3. **Transfer Functions** (`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`):
   - Ensure `_to` is not a zero address.
   - Account for balances before and after transfers, allowing conditional success/failure based on transaction validity.
   - Correct usage of `forall` iteratively asserts through arrays of tokens.
   - Check that balances are enough for transfers, and confirm consistency for both self-transfers and regular transfers.

These annotations follow ERC1155 standards and verify the expected correctness of operations using `solc-verify`.
