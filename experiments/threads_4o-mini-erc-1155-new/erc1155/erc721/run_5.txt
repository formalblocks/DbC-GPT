=== USER [2025-04-17 03:53:51] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** Ensures the return value matches the token balance for a specific owner and ID.
- **balanceOfBatch:** Verifies that the returned batch balances match the respective owner and token ID pairs.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Ensures that the operator's approval status is updated as specified.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Confirms the return of the correct approval status for the given owner and operator.
- **safeTransferFrom:** Ensures balances are adjusted correctly between `_from` and `_to` after a transfer (or remains unchanged if it is a self-transfer) and verifies that `_to` is not the zero address.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom:** Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applied to batch operations, ensuring both initial and final states are compliant.

        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** Ensures the returned balance is correct based on the internal mapping `_balances`.
- **balanceOfBatch:** Verifies that the `batchBalances` array corresponds accurately to each `_owner` and `_id` pair and the lengths of the input arrays match.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Confirms that the `_operator` approval status is appropriately set in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Confirms that the `approved` return value directly reflects the current approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **safeTransferFrom:** Guarantees token balances adjust correctly between `_from` and `_to` (or remains unchanged if it is a self-transfer) and ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom:** Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applied to batches, ensuring all arrays have the same length and token balances are correctly maintained and adjusted.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:54:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** Ensures the function returns the current balance of the specified `_owner` for the given `_id`.
- **balanceOfBatch:** Validates the `batchBalances` array accurately reflects corresponding balances for each `(_owners[i], _ids[i])` pair and the arrays have matching lengths.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Confirms that `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]` is set to `_approved` as expected.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Verifies that `approved` correctly reflects the approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **safeTransferFrom:** Ensures correct balance changes if `_from` and `_to` are different (or none if it's a self-transfer), and checks that `_to` is not the zero address.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom:** Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring lengths of arrays match and taking care of possible self-transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:55:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** The balance of the token type `_id` for `_owner` must be returned as it is stored in `_balances`.
- **balanceOfBatch:** Ensure that the returned array `batchBalances` reflects the sum of balances for all pairs of `_owners[i]` and `_ids[i]`, and the lengths match the inputs.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Ensure that the `_operator` is correctly approved or disapproved.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Confirm that `approved` reflects whether `_operator` is authorized.
- **safeTransferFrom:** Check the postcondition for balance adjustments when transferring tokens, confirming non-zero `_to`.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom:** Include conditions similar to `safeTransferFrom` but for batch transfers, ensuring array length consistency and checking for non-zero `_to`.
