    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:08:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations provide formal specifications capturing expected behaviors according to the ERC-1155 standard. They use specified state variables and ensure consistency between related functions. Also, where transfers might not alter balances (like self-transfers), appropriate considerations are included.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:09:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
- **Function Postconditions**: Each function is annotated with its postcondition. View functions return the expected state, transaction functions modify states as per ERC-1155 rules, considering exceptions and special cases like self-transfers.
- **Consistency**: The annotations reflect state changes or invariants based on standard transaction rules for ERC-1155.
- **Events**: Functions include emitting relevant events as per the requirements, enhancing the traceability of actions.
- **Array Handling**: Proper checks for length consistency between `_ids` and `_values` reflect important preconditions for batch operations.
- **Safety Checks**: Functions include appropriate conditions to ensure correctness in operation including self-transfers as per guidelines.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:09:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
- **Postconditions**: The `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` functions directly output the expected balance using the `_balances` state mapping. Transfer functions have postconditions reflecting balance changes and include cases for successful and unsuccessful executions using `success`.
- **Length Checks**: The `balanceOfBatch` function includes checks for the equality of input array lengths.
- **Event Emissions**: Functions that modify state and include transfers specify that they emit relevant events.
- **Safety & Validity**: The preconditions implied by postconditions ensure that addresses and array lengths are valid during batch operations.
- **Consistency**: All functions are crafted to maintain consistency and display expected behavior in line with the ERC-1155 specification. 

These annotations enable formal verification tools to ascertain the correctness of each function based on its defined behavior and risk scenarios, thus ensuring robust smart contract security and functionality.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:10:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points
- **Postconditions**: Postconditions are provided for each function to state the expected state changes as per the ERC-1155 standard.
- **Balances Functionality**: 
  - `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` functions relate the return value directly to `_balances`.
  - `balanceOfBatch` includes checks for array consistency using `forall`.
- **Transfer Functions**: They incorporate postconditions for successful transfers, and handle failures, ensuring consistent state. They also consider self-transfers where balance remains unchanged.
- **Approval Functions**: `setApprovalForAll` includes a postcondition to ensure the `_operatorApprovals` mapping reflects changes, and specifies that `ApprovalForAll` is emitted.
- **Event Emission**: For each function that modifies the state, relevant events (`TransferSingle`, `TransferBatch`, `ApprovalForAll`) are annotated to assert their emissions.

These postconditions ensure that the contract’s actions adhere to the ERC-1155 specification, providing expected outcomes and invariants for state changes and returns.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:10:44] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Aspects:
- **View Functions**: The postconditions relate the output directly to the state of `_balances` for `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`.
- **Approval Functions**: `setApprovalForAll` modifies `_operatorApprovals` and ensures that `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.
- **Transfer Logic**: 
  - `safeTransferFrom` handles balance updates for each transfer, accounting for successful updates or termination of unsuccessful operations.
  - `safeBatchTransferFrom` ensures parallel effects for batch operations encapsulating all token transfers.
- **Handling Self-Transfers**: Special handling ensures that when `_from` equals `_to`, balances are unchanged.
- **Events**: All modifying functions correctly annotate the emission of relevant events.

These annotations cover correctness of state transitions, provide indicative feedback for the balance state, and ensure compliance with the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:11:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
- **State Mappings**: View functions associate the result directly with the `_balances` mapping.
- **Operator Approvals**: `setApprovalForAll` modifies `_operatorApprovals` and includes the `ApprovalForAll` event.
- **Transfer Functions**: 
  - Conditions consider unsuccessful operations and manage state for both success and failure cases.
  - They handle self-transfers by ensuring balances are unchanged if `_from` equals `_to`.
- **Event Emissions**: Functions which change state specify that they emit relevant events.
- **Array Length Checks**: `safeBatchTransferFrom` enforces array length consistency. 

These annotations ensure state transition correctness, follow the ERC-1155 standard, and provide formal guarantees regarding operations and events.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:11:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

- **Balance Functions**: Postconditions for `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` functions relate the returned balance directly to the current state in `_balances`.
- **Approval Functionality**: `setApprovalForAll` updates `_operatorApprovals` with an emitted `ApprovalForAll` event.
- **Transfer Functions**: 
  - Includes state transitions for balances in successful transfers while considering conditions for transactions to be valid.
  - Defines cases for handling self-transfers maintaining invariant balances.
  - Ensures proper array length checks.
- **Consistency and Safety**: Across all related functions like transfer and transferFrom postconditions, synchronizing behavior with ERC-1155 expectations.

These postconditions provide formal specification and expected properties, ensuring that the contract behavior matches its intended functionalities.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:11:52] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:
- **Balance Functions**: The `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` relate directly to the `_balances` mapping.
- **Approval Functions**: Ensure that the mapping `_operatorApprovals` reflects the caller's intent and emits `ApprovalForAll`.
- **Transfer Functions**:
  - Conditions cover both successful state transitions and handle special considerations for self-transfers.
  - Incorporates array length checks where applicable.
  - Defines expected post-transfer states after event emissions for `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch`.
  
These postconditions offer a robust formal specification for the ERC1155 contract, verifying behavior according to the ERC standard and ensuring operational correctness.

### Key Points:
- **Balances**: The `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` functions directly access `_balances` to return the current balance.
- **Approval Management**: The `setApprovalForAll` function updates `_operatorApprovals` and emits the `ApprovalForAll` event.
- **Transfer Functions**:
  - Account for successful and unsuccessful scenarios by considering self-transfers.
  - Include conditions for both balance decrement and increment, enforcing the requirement that `_to` is not the zero address.
  - Check for length constraints on arrays in `safeBatchTransferFrom`.
- **Event Logging**: Annotations ensure that `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` events are correctly emitted as per the ERC-1155 standard.

These conditions help guarantee the correctness of the contract as specified by the ERC-1155 standard, ensuring that all operations perform as expected or revert when preconditions aren't met.
