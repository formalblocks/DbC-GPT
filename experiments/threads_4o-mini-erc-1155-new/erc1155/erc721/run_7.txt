    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:00:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **`balanceOf`**: Postcondition asserts that the function's return value is equal to the current balance for the `_owner` and `_id`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Postconditions verify that:
  1. The length of `_owners` is the same as `_ids` and `batchBalances`.
  2. Each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the balance in `_balances` for each respective `_owner` and `_id`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Postcondition ensures that the approval status for `_operator` is updated correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Postcondition asserts the returned `approved` value matches the value in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**: Postconditions ensure:
  1. Transfer is successful (decreases `_from` balance and increases `_to` balance) or a self-transfer does not change balances.
  2. Total token supply for `_id` remains constant except when minting (`_from` is `0x0`) or burning (`_to` is `0x0`).

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Postconditions verify:
  1. The length of `_ids` matches `_values`.
  2. Each token transfer within the batch correctly updates balances or the total supply.

        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
- **`balanceOf`**: Checks that the balance returned matches the stored balance for a given `_owner` and `_id`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures length matching between `_owners`, `_ids`, and `batchBalances`, and checks each `batchBalances` entry reflects the correct balances for each owner-token pair.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms the approval status for the operator on behalf of msg.sender has been set correctly.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the function return reflects the stored approval state for a given owner-operator pair.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - If `_from` is equal to `_to`, balances should remain unchanged.
  - Otherwise, validates that after the transfer, the sender's balance decreases by `_value` and recipient's balance increases by `_value`.
  - Ensures total token sums are preserved unless minting (from address is zero) or burning (to address is zero).

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensures that array lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
  - For each token transfer, ensures that if `_from` is equal to `_to`, balances remain unchanged, else checks that transfer balances are updated correctly.
  - Validates token preservation unless minting or burning.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:01:20] ===
To correctly annotate the `ERC1155` contract interface with formal verification conditions, we need to ensure that the postconditions match the expected behaviors as required by the ERC1155 standard. The use of `forall` in annotations requires specific syntax for solc-verify, and I'll correct these annotations.

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

### Explanation

- **`balanceOf`**: The postcondition ensures that the function returns the correct balance of the specified token type for the given owner.
  
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
  - Ensures lengths match for `_owners`, `_ids`, and `batchBalances`.
  - Uses a correct `forall` syntax to ensure each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds with the `_balances` for each `_owner` and `_id` pairing.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms the state of `_operatorApprovals` for the given operator is updated correctly.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Postcondition ensures that it returns the correct approval status for the queried operator.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
  - For self-transfers (`_from == _to`), it ensures balances remain unchanged.
  - Otherwise, ensures the sender's balance decreases and recipient's balance increases accordingly.
  - Maintains token balance integrity unless minting (`_from == address(0)`) or burning (`_to == address(0)`).

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
  - Ensures the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are the same.
  - Uses `forall` syntax to check each transferred token amount results in correct balance changes or preservation.
  - Maintains the overall integrity of balances unless involving mint or burn operations.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:01:49] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Correct Annotations:
- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: 
  - Ensure the returned balance is the same as the state variable for both single and batched requests.
  - The `forall` syntax is correctly fixed and should work with solc-verify.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
  - Validates the approval status has been recorded in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
  - Directly returns the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
  - Handles both changes in balances for transfers and preservation of balances for self-transfers.
  - Maintains invariant for total balances unless tokens are being minted or burned.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensures `_ids` and `_values` have the same length.
  - Checks that each transfer updates balances on `_from` and `_to` respectively while maintaining total balance integrity for minting and burning exceptions. 

These corrections address syntax issues and ensure intended properties are respected, making the specification ready for formal verification using solc-verify.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:02:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf`**: Verifies that the function returns the stored balance for the specified token ID and owner.
  
- **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Ensures the batch sizes (`_owners` and `_ids`) are equal and `batchBalances` matches the length of `_owners`.
  - Uses corrected `forall` syntax to ensure each entry reflects the correct balance.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**:
  - Confirms the `_operatorApprovals` mapping is updated to reflect the new approval status for the operator.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**:
  - Asserts that the returned value corresponds to the stored approval status for the given owner and operator.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - The condition for self-transfers (`_from == _to`) ensures balances remain unchanged.
  - For actual transfers (non-self transfers), balances are correctly decremented from `_from` and incremented for `_to`.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Verifies that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` arrays match and uses a corrected `forall` syntax for batch transfers that validates balances for transfers or self-transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:02:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Corrections:
- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the result reflects the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.
  
- **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Checks list lengths are equal.
  - Each entry in `batchBalances` matches the respective balance in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**:
  - Confirms that the approval status is updated in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**:
  - Ensures returned approval status matches the stored value for the given owner and operator.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Handles self-transfers by keeping balances unchanged.
  - For transfers, validates the decrement from `_from` and increment to `_to`.
  
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Confirms lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
  - Uses correct syntax to verify each pair's balances are correctly modified or stay unchanged for self-transfers. 

These annotations should be compatible with solc-verify's requirements and accurately represent the functional expectations of ERC1155.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:03:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the balance is accurately reflected as per the internal state variable `_balances`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Confirms that the list lengths are equal.
  - Verifies that each returned balance in `batchBalances` corresponds correctly to the owner's balance in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
  - Validates that the `_operatorApprovals` is set correctly for the `_operator`.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**:
  - Checks that the function return matches the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`** and **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensure balances are updated correctly in both the single and batch transfer functions.
  - The conditions account for unchanged balances in self-transfers and validate that the total balance remains consistent, accounting for minting (from zero address) or burning (to zero address).

These annotations should align with solc-verify's format and the ERC1155 standard, ensuring accurate formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:03:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's annotate the ERC1155 contract interface correctly with formal verification conditions using the proper solc-verify syntax for postconditions. The annotations will reflect the conditions as per the ERC1155 standard requirements.

```solidity

### Explanation

- **`balanceOf`**: Asserts that the function's return value equals the balance recorded in the `_balances` mapping for the specified `owner` and `id`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Ensures the lengths of `_owners` and `_ids` are equal, and `batchBalances` matches the length of `_owners`.
  - Uses the `forall` syntax to ensure all balances in `batchBalances` correspond to the balances in `_balances` for each `_owner` and `_id`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Verifies that `_operatorApprovals` is updated to reflect the new approval status for the specified `operator`.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms the returned `approved` status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Manages self-transfers by leaving balances unchanged.
  - In actual transfers, decreases `_from` and increases `_to` by `_value`.
  - Ensures total supply remains consistent, unless minting or burning occurs.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Validates that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are the same.
  - Uses `forall` to check every transfer pair, reducing `_from` balances by the amount and increasing `_to` balances while keeping the overall balance consistent unless minting or burning.

These annotations should accurately reflect the logic for formal verification with solc-verify.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:04:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's annotate the ERC1155 contract with the appropriate postconditions for formal verification using solc-verify syntax. We'll ensure the conditions are correct for each function and match ERC1155 specifications.

### Explanation

- **`balanceOf`**: Relates the return value to the state variable `_balances` ensuring correctness for specific `_owner` and `_id`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Ensures array length consistency.
  - Uses `forall` syntax to align each `owner`, `id` pair with the correct balance in `batchBalances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures the approval state in `_operatorApprovals` is correctly updated as per the input parameters.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Verifies that the function returns the current approval status from `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Addresses the balance changes correctly for regular transfers.
  - Handles minting and burning by checking zero address implications on `_from` and `_to`.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Checks lengths of supplied arrays are equal.
  - Uses the `forall` construct to validate balance updates for the batch, handling possible minting and burning cases. 

These postconditions should adequately match the operations described in the ERC1155 specification and be correctly structured for verification tools.
