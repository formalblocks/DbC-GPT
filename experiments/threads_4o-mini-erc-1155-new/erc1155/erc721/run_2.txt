=== USER [2025-04-17 03:40:27] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
1. **balanceOf** and **balanceOfBatch**: Postconditions ensure that `balance` and `batchBalances` reflect the balances from `_balances`.

2. **setApprovalForAll**: Postcondition ensures `_operatorApprovals` reflects changes after setting approval.

3. **isApprovedForAll**: Postconditions ensure the return value reflects the actual status in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **safeTransferFrom**: Checks that the operation is authorized, `_to` is not address zero, and updates the balances correctly. It handles self-transfers by ensuring balance consistency if `_from` equals `_to`.

5. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch operations. It ensures arrays are of the same length, transactions are authorized, and balances are correctly updated or unchanged for self-transfers.

These conditions are consistent with the standards and enforce the intended behavior, including typical error and validation checks.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:41:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:

1. **`balanceOfBatch` Postcondition**:
   - Fixed the `forall` syntax by ensuring `i` is correctly bounded within the length of `_owners`, and it indexes the array.

2. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Postcondition**:
   - Ensured proper condition bounding using `forall` statement with index check `i < _ids.length`.
   - Used exact mappings and conditions to validate transfer effects, ensuring update integrity or no change for self-transfers.

3. **Ensuring Postconditions**:
   - Included checks for the `_to` address being non-zero to capture revert condition validations.
   - Handel self-transfers by checking equality in `_from` and `_to` while ensuring balance consistency. 

These enhancements make the formal verification conditions more comprehensible and aligned with ERC standards and requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:41:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Modifications Made:

1. **`balanceOfBatch` Postcondition**:
   - Modified `forall` syntax to ensure proper verification logic, ensuring `i` is checked within bounds and accomplished via conditional chain `implies`.

2. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Postcondition**:
   - Adjusted `forall` to ensure each index is adequately verified within bounds and set proper conditions using `implies`.
   - Used relational expressions to apply conditions only when `_ids[i]` and `_values[i]` are appropriately set.

These modifications aim to resolve previous parsing issues while adhering to the logical structure needed for ERC1155 compliance.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:42:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:
1. **`balanceOfBatch` Postcondition**:
   - Corrected the syntax of `forall` so that it specifies a comprehensible range for iteration effectively.

2. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Postcondition**:
   - Ensured `forall` loop ranges were clearly structured with a valid conditional logic checking array bounds.
   - Additional logic ensures proper verification without expecting unwanted parsing or bounding errors.

These refined annotations aim to offer consistency across the ERC1155 functions while incorporating correct verification syntax.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:42:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Fixes:
1. **`forall (uint i)`**: Using the proper syntax inside the annotations to specify iteration bounds and logic.

2. **Range Specifications**: Ensured the proper use of logical statements and bounds and covered all indexes adequately, reflecting the required preconditions and postconditions logic.

These changes are designed to adhere to the encoding logic for verification, providing a sound framework for verifying contract behaviors.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:42:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's refine the annotations for the `ERC1155` contract functions by fixing the syntax errors. The correct `solc-verify` annotations should properly use logical and comparison operators in the postconditions, avoiding misplaced parentheses or syntax errors:

### Explanation:
1. **Correct Syntax**: Ensures proper verification logic using `forall` for loops with valid comparisons and conditional expressions with `==>` for logical implications.

2. **Verification Annotations**: Adopts proper usage of ERC1155 conditions reflecting on `_balances` and `_operatorApprovals`.

3. **Self-Transfers**: Incorporates special handling for self-transfers (`_from == _to`) to ensure balance consistency.

This gives a correct syntax aligned with expected behaviors while maintaining the crucial conditions as per ERC standard guidelines.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:43:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 03:43:18] ===
Let's refine the annotations for the `ERC1155` functions with correct syntax and logical operators compatible with `solc-verify`, ensuring they reflect the expected behaviors as per the ERC1155 standard:

```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Logical Operators**: Used `if ... then ... else` for conditions needing different treatments based on `_from` vs. `_to` comparisons.
   
2. **Array Indexing**: Verified accurate bounds and consistent use of `forall` syntax for indexing.

3. **Consistency**: Applied similar annotations across relevant functions to ensure logical consistency and correct parameter usage.

These annotations provide a formal verification framework that adheres to the standard for ERC1155 by ensuring that all balance changes occur correctly and conditions are explicitly checked.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:43:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
1. **Conditional Expressions**: Used `||` (logical OR) and explicit comparisons for self-transfers with `_from == _to`.

2. **Quantifiers**: Ensured use of `forall (uint i)` with correct `=>` for logical implication to check each element in `_ids` and `_values`.

3. ** Equality Checks**: Introduced `__verifier_old_uint` for referencing previous state values during state transitions, maintaining proper consistency across transfer functions. 

These annotations should be correctly formatted for use with `solc-verify` and appropriately follow the ERC1155 token behavior standards, aligning with its logical requirements and practices for consistency across transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-17 03:44:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf` Function**: The postcondition verifies the balance directly from the `_balances` mapping.
- **`balanceOfBatch` Function**: The postcondition ensures that the `batchBalances` array matches the balances from the `_balances` mapping for each given `_id` and `_owner`.
- **`setApprovalForAll` Function**: Ensures that `_operatorApprovals` is updated correctly.
- **`isApprovedForAll` Function**: Reflects the approval status directly.
- **Transfer Functions**:
  - Ensure that transfers handle both self-transfers and normal transfers.
  - Protect against transfers to address zero.
  - Check approvals.
  - Balance updates properly reflect the transfer, including updates for relevant mappings.

This setup addresses the required behavior in line with the ERC1155 standard while correcting syntactical errors for use with the `solc-verify` tool.
