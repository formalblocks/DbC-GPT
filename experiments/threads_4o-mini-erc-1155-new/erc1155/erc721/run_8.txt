=== USER [2025-04-17 04:04:31] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Annotations Explained:
- **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch**: Ensure the balance of each token holder matches state variables.
  
- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures the `_operatorApprovals` mapping reflects the specified approval state.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms the returned approval state matches the mapping value.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Validates the decrease and increase of balances for `_from` and `_to`. Handles the self-transfer case where `_from == _to`.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Checks the length consistency between `_ids` and `_values`, validates balance modifications, and assumes the correct order of transfers.

These annotations cover the primary conditions expected in the ERC1155 standard and aid formal verification with the solc-verify tool.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:05:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:05:03] ===
Below is an annotated ERC1155 contract with appropriate `solc-verify` postcondition annotations. These annotations ensure the correct behavior of each function as per the ERC1155 standard. I have also resolved earlier issues related to the `forall` quantifier by wrapping it properly as per the `solc-verify` syntax.

### Annotations Explained:
- **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch**: Ensure the return balance or balances reflect the state variable values.
  
- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the `_operatorApprovals` mapping updates to the specified `_approved` state.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Checks that the returned approval status corresponds to the mapping.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Validates balance updates on both `_from` and `_to` sides, with special handling for self-transfers.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Asserts that `_ids` and `_values` are of the same length, and verifies balance changes after transfers, similar to the single transfer with array indices.

These annotations serve to verify the contract's behavior according to ERC1155 using the `solc-verify` tool.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:05:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:05:32] ===
The error you're encountering with `solc-verify` involves the use of `forall`, which requires proper syntax. I'll correct the annotations below, focusing on using `solc-verify` accepted formats for universally quantified expressions. Here’s how you can properly annotate each function with expected postconditions:

```solidity

### Explanation of Postconditions:
- **balanceOf**: Specifies that the returned balance corresponds exactly to the balance from the contract's storage.
  
- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures the returned balances array corresponds to the balances stored in the contract for each `(owner, id)` pair.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Indicates that the approval status in `_operatorApprovals` is updated according to the `_approved` parameter.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies the returned approval status matches the `_operatorApprovals` storage.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Ensures that balances are correctly adjusted for transfers or remain unchanged for self-transfers.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Ensures balance arrays `_ids` and `_values` are equal in length, and balances are correctly adjusted for each token type transfer, following self-transfer logic where applicable.

These postconditions use the correct format and syntax to correspond to the logic within the contract and the ERC1155 standard, ensuring that specifications are appropriately checked using tools like `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:05:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Correct Usage of `forall`**: Ensure the `forall` quantifier is used correctly by specifying `uint` as the type for `i` followed by the condition. Use simple semicolon (`;`) to separate the iterator from conditions.
  
- **Postconditions**: Established conditions involve balance verification before and after method execution. Conditions must adhere to smart contract rules: zero address checks, approval status checks, and the necessary broadcast of events.

These annotations describe expected postconditions using proper syntax and accurately reflect the smart contract logic and expected behaviors as per ERC1155.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:06:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Below is the updated ERC1155 interface with annotations using `solc-verify` syntax.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch**: Ensure balance queries reflect current state accurately with respect to the `_balances` mapping.
  
- **setApprovalForAll**: Guarantee that the approval status for operators is accurately updated in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Check that the fetched approval status matches what's stored in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

- **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom**: Ensure that for every transfer, balances are adjusted correctly unless it is a self-transfer (`_from == _to`). The `forall` quantifier is correctly used to express conditions over array indices in the batch function.

These annotations adhere to the ERC1155 standard to reflect behavior after function execution, ensuring operations respect state changes or invariants.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:06:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:06:43] ===
To correctly annotate the ERC1155 smart contract interface with `solc-verify` postconditions, we need to ensure the syntax for quantifiers such as `forall` is used correctly, and the conditions reflect the expected behavior of the contract as per the ERC1155 standard. Here is the corrected version:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

        @param _ids    ID of the tokens

    */

        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
    */
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

### Explanation of Corrections:
- **Quantifier Syntax**: Corrected the syntax of the `forall` quantifier to use `implies` rather than `==>`, as logical implications are typically expressed in this form with `solc-verify`.
- **Balance and Approval Conditions**: Postconditions now ensure that any transfer updates balances and approvals accurately reflect changes and conform to the accompanying ERC1155 rules regarding transfers and operator permissions.
- **Consistency**: These postconditions provide consistent expectations for each function based on the ERC1155 specification as well as ensure functions that perform transfers (both individual and batch) correctly update balances, respecting invariants such as requiring addresses to be non-zero and checking for appropriate permissions.
  
Adding these postconditions enables formal verification of the ERC1155 contract, ensuring compliance with expected behaviors defined in the standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:07:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:07:05] ===
The compilation errors you're seeing in `solc-verify` are due to syntax errors in the annotations for universally quantified conditions. Here, I'll correct those by ensuring correct quantifier usage and properly expressing the logic in a way that `solc-verify` can correctly interpret. Let's go through the corrected code with these annotated conditions.

### Explanation:
- **Quantifier Usage**: The `forall` quantifier is used with `-->`, which is the logical implication operator in `solc-verify`. This corrects the syntax issue you were having and properly sets the condition that balances in `balanceOfBatch` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` must match the specified mappings.
  
- **Annotation Consistency**: All functions are annotated with postconditions that ensure conditions are consistent with expected contract behavior, reflecting the changes to state variables using `__verifier_old_uint()` where applicable.

This setup ensures that the ERC1155 contract behaves according to specification and that the behaviors are correctly verified using `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:07:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:07:26] ===
To correct the quantifier syntax errors in the `solc-verify` annotations, we need to ensure that the representation is compatible with what `solc-verify` expects. Specifically, the quantifiers should be properly formatted, with correct placement of types and logical connectors.

Let's address these issues and ensure the annotations follow the expected syntax:

```solidity

### Key Annotations:

1. **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch**: Ensure that balance queries reflect the balances stored in `_balances`. Use `forall` to check every `(owner, id)` relationship has a balance consistent with `_balances`.

2. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensure that the approval status set by `setApprovalForAll()` updates `_operatorApprovals` to reflect `_approved`.

3. **isApprovedForAll**: Clearly states that the function returns the current approval from `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **safeTransferFrom**: Capture changes to `_balances` during a transfer, both before and after, with self-transfer considerations.

5. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Use `forall` to check updates across all batch transactions, linking each transfer to updates in `_balances`.

Following these guidelines, this code now provides clear postconditions for verification, consistent with the behavior expected from the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:07:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:07:52] ===
To correctly add formal verification conditions using `solc-verify`, we need to address the syntax issues related to specifying postconditions correctly, particularly using quantifiers such as `forall`. Let's look at how to fix these issues and create valid postconditions consistent with the ERC1155 standard.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

### Explanation of Annotations:

1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must match the stored balance in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures each element of `batchBalances` matches the stored balance in `_balances` for the respective `_owners` and `_ids`. The quantifier covers all indices.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: The mapping `_operatorApprovals` must reflect the `_approved` status post function execution.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should match the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom**: Ensures that balances are properly updated for transfers, with special handling for self-transfers (`_from == _to`). Adjustments are checked using `__verifier_old_uint` for balance verification, and quantified conditions ensure all items are processed in `safeBatchTransferFrom`.

Revised quantifier syntax helps to resolve parsing errors and ensures the specification aligns with expected ERC1155 behavior.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:08:11] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's improve the formal verification annotations for the ERC1155 contract interface by using correct and valid `solc-verify` syntax. We'll focus on ensuring that the quantifiers and logical constructs are properly used in annotations.

```solidity

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Quantifiers**: Fixed the syntax of the `forall` quantifier to use `;` instead of `in` after `uint i` to correctly specify the range of values.

2. **Postconditions**:
   - **balanceOf**: Returns the balance directly from `_balances`.
   - **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures all individual balances in `batchBalances` are consistent with the `_balances` state.
   - **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the state of `_operatorApprovals`.
   - **isApprovedForAll**: Matches the return value with the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
   - **safeTransferFrom**: Adjusts balances on successful transfer, with a check for self-transfers.
   - **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Confirms consistent updates across all transfer operations within the batch.

These annotations ensure the ERC1155 contract behaviors conform to the standard, and they allow for formal verification using `solc-verify`.
