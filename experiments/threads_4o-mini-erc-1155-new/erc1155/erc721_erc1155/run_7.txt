    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These formal specifications use postconditions to ensure the compliance and correctness of this ERC-1155 smart contract as per its intended behavior defined in the standard. The postcondition annotations are aimed at ensuring the integrity of state variables when these contract functions are invoked.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:08:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:08:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

These annotations cover all required postconditions specified by the ERC-1155 standard, ensuring compliance and correctness of the token transfers, approvals, and balances. They should help in guiding both developers and automatic verification tools about expected state changes in this contract.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:09:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

I have updated the condition where dynamic arrays are involved, particularly for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. This adjustment accounts better for potential edge cases in the lengths of inputs and consistency in indexing operations. Such careful handling should amend verification issues that arise due to potential mismatch or incorrect assumptions regarding array manipulations. If an issue still persists in your environment, further code context might be essential for deeper diagnosis.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:10:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To ensure the ERC1155 smart contract interface includes appropriate formal verification annotations using `solc-verify`, we need to address the postconditions carefully, especially in handling batch transfers.

Here are the key points addressed:

- **Array Length Checks:** Ensure that `_ids` and `_values` have the same length, preventing index errors.
- **Batch Transfer Logic:** Use a guard to ensure `_balances` for each token ID in `_ids` is sufficient before proceeding with the transfer.
- **Safe Address Handling:** Ensure `_to` is not the zero address, consistent with the specification that forbids transferring to zero address.

These postconditions should assist in verifying that transfers, both single and batch, adhere to the formal rules of the ERC1155 specification. If issues remain, checking the implementation context for any overlooked constraints is recommended.

To provide appropriate formal verification conditions for the `ERC1155` smart contract interface using `solc-verify`, let's focus on ensuring postconditions accurately describe behavior and state changes according to the ERC-1155 standard. We'll also address the potential issues with batch transfers. Here's the annotated contract with correct postconditions:

### Key Adjustments Made:
- **Correct Length Validation:** Ensures `_ids` and `_values` arrays are of the same length to prevent index mismatches.
- **Non-zero Address Check:** Confirms `_to` is not the zero address to follow safe transfer requirements.
- **Batch Transfer Validations:** Ensures that for every element in `_ids`, the sender's balance is adequate, balances are properly updated, and batch processes are consistent.

These changes are aimed at ensuring the annotated smart contract complies correctly with stated ERC-1155 requirements and resolves potential verification failures. If the formal verification tool still reports the same or new issues, it would usually indicate the need for additional context around contract implementation.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:11:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **Ensuring Consistency**: Each item in `_ids` corresponds correctly with `_values`, enforcing array length checks and appropriate updates to each `_balances` entry for both owner and recipient.
- **Array Index Safety**: Postcondition checks are updated to ensure operation safety under each loop-based transfer condition.
- **Non-zero Transfer Address**: It is verified that `_to` is never the zero address across function calls.

This setup should reinforce the validity of batch operations under these postconditions. If verification failures continue, examining the specific implementation inside these functions might be necessary to match logical constraints precisely.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Aspects:
1. **Array Length Check**: Ensure `_ids` and `_values` lengths are equal.
2. **Address Validation**: Confirm `_to` is a non-zero address to adhere to safe transfer requirements.
3. **Balance Verification**: For each `i`, previous balance of the sender must be sufficient to cover transfers, and resulting balances must reflect the same.
4. **Account for Self-Transfers**: If `_from` equals `_to`, adjust postconditions to reflect no change in balances.

This setup ensures compliance with ERC-1155 standards and robust handling of balance logic, even in batch operations.

To effectively annotate the ERC1155 smart contract using `solc-verify` with proper postconditions for formal verification, we need to ensure that each function aligns with the ERC-1155 standard principles while maintaining appropriate checks, especially for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. Here's how you can appropriately annotate the functions:

### Explanation:
1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: Ensure that queried balances reflect the values in `_balances`.
2. **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Maintain conditions on operator approvals.
3. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Include address checks, approval checks, and balance transfers with special handling for self-transfers.
4. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Enforce array length checks, approvals, and balance transfers per token type.

These annotations should ideally ensure that postconditions hold and verification logically follows the expected ERC-1155 behavior. If error messages persist, consider assessing implementation for additional state transitions not covered by these high-level annotations.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:13:30] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
- **Length Equality Check**: This ensures `_ids` and `_values` arrays are of the same length.
- **Zero Address Check**: The `_to` address should be a non-zero address to prevent sending tokens to a non-existent account.
- **Approval and Balance Checks**: Verifications include ensuring that necessary approvals are set or the sender themself is initiating the transfer and that balances are sufficient for each token ID in batch operations.
- **Handling Self-Transfers**: Conditions are set to handle the fact that if the sender is the same as the recipient, token balances should not change. 

These conditions align with the ERC-1155 standard, maintaining the expected behavior across the described contracts and providing formal verification annotations appropriately. If there are persistent post-verification errors, they might require a deep dive into the implementation details or the specific configuration of the verification tool.
