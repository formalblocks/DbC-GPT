    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **balanceOf**: The postcondition asserts that the returned balance matches the recorded balance for the provided `_owner` and `_id`.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Three postconditions ensure that the batch of balances corresponds to the input arrays in terms of length and content.

- **setApprovalForAll**: The postcondition indicates that the operator approval status for a given caller and operator is set appropriately.

- **isApprovedForAll**: The postcondition reflects the approval status of an operator for a specific `_owner`.

- **safeTransferFrom**: These postconditions cover the key aspects of ERC-1155 transfer logic:
  - The recipient address must not be the zero address.
  - The caller must be an approved operator or the token holder.
  - The specified value must be available in the balance of the holder.
  - The balance of the sender is decreased by `_value`, while the recipient’s balance increases by the same amount.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Includes similar assertions as `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers:
  - Ensures the recipient address is valid.
  - Validates the lengths of ID and value arrays are equal.
  - Approves the operator if necessary, checks sufficient balance, and updates sender and recipient balances.

These annotations aim to ensure consistency with the ERC-1155 standard and anticipates common successful behavior and failure points.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:15:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 06:15:16] ===
To properly annotate the `ERC1155` contract interface with formal verification postconditions, we need to ensure that each function correctly reflects the behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard. We will provide the appropriate postconditions for each function, keeping in mind the verification guidelines and state variables such as `_balances` and `_operatorApprovals`.

### Explanation
- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance is the same as what is stored in `_balances` for a given `_owner` and token `_id`.
- **balanceOfBatch**: Checks that balances are correctly mapped to each owner/token pair. The output array's length corresponds to the input lengths, and each balance matches the stored value.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Asserts that the operator's approval status is correctly set.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures approval status matches the stored value.
- **safeTransferFrom**: 
  - Verifies the recipient address is non-zero.
  - Ensures the caller is authorized to transfer tokens or is the token holder.
  - Validates sufficient balance is present before transferring.
  - Updates balances reflecting the deduction from the sender and increment to the recipient.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Extends single transfer conditions to batch processing.
  - Validates address, array length consistency, approval status, and balance sufficiency.
  - Ensures that balances are updated in accordance with both arrays, maintaining the original relative order of operations.

These annotations are designed to achieve consistency and maintain conformity with the specified behavior of the ERC1155 standard. If verification errors still occur, it may be necessary to further examine specific contract logic or additional conditions per the implementation.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 06:15:59] ===
Let's address the task of adding appropriate postconditions for an ERC1155 smart contract interface. From the error provided, there might be a misunderstanding or need for refinement in the postconditions, especially in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

### Explanation

- **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches what is stored in `_balances`.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Enforces that the return values match the corresponding balances in the `_balances` map, with lengths conforming to inputs.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is set as expected.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Reflects the true state of operator approval for the given owner.

- **safeTransferFrom**: 
  - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
  - Verifies the caller is an approved operator or the token holder.
  - Validates sufficient balance before transfer.
  - Updates balances reflecting a deduction from the `_from` account and increment to the `_to` account.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Checks for a valid `_to` address and matching lengths of the `_ids` and `_values` arrays.
  - Assures the caller is either the token holder or has been approved for all transfers.
  - Verifies sufficient balances for each transfer in the batch before proceeding.
  - Adjusts balances for each token type as per the operations defined, preventing void transfers (where `_from == _to`, balances remain unchanged).

These postconditions ensure correct functionality as per ERC1155 and address potential edge cases like zero-address errors or improper balance calculations, all while meeting the conditions laid out in your requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:16:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To address the issue in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, we need to ensure that the postconditions correctly reflect every operation's expected outcome in a comprehensive manner, handling array operations accurately.

### Explanation

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the function returns the correct balance from the `_balances` mapping.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that for each pair of addresses and IDs, the resulting batch balances match those recorded in the state, with both input arrays having the same length.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the `_operatorApprovals` mapping reflects the correct approval status after calling the function.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Assures the function returns the current approval status for a given operator and owner.

- **safeTransferFrom**: 
  - Ensures `_to` is not a zero address.
  - Verifies that the caller is either the token holder or an approved operator.
  - Confirms that enough tokens are available before the transfer occurs.
  - Validates the balance updates correctly represent the decrement from `_from` and increment to `_to`.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Ensures the recipient address `_to` is not zero and that `_ids` and `_values` arrays are of equal length.
  - Validates that tokens are transferred only if the sender is authorized (either owner or approved).
  - Confirms sufficient balances exist for transfers, decrementing the sender's balances and incrementing the recipient's.
  - Each transfer operation adheres to requirements without performing changes for sender and recipient being the same.

These postconditions align with the ERC1155 standard and refine the logical assertions to align with the verifier expectations. The focus is on ensuring array values and indices are correctly managed, handling both success and failure scenarios under the standard rules and conditions.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:17:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 06:17:55] ===
To ensure the postconditions correctly capture the expected behavior of an ERC1155 contract and eliminate any potential errors in verification, we need to carefully articulate the conditions while validating batch operations. We should ensure each condition accounts for the necessary checks and updates to balances for each token transfer.

Here's how these conditions may be correctly expressed:

### Key Adjustments

- **forall on Balances**: The verification error might come from insufficient validation over all balances during batch operations. We ensure the condition works for all index operations and properly adjusts balances based on preceding conditions.
  
- **Assertion Order**: Ensure `forall` expressions precisely match transfer logic, account for each token, and check balance states against previous values correctly.

- **Self-Transfer Handling**: Ensure self-transfers preserve original balances (_from != _to), which allows state consistency even when processing same-address transfers.

The logic behind these postconditions centers on ensuring clear, correct, and comprehensive conditions for each aspect of the specified functionality by the ERC1155 standard. Adjustments in state assertions need to accommodate batch processing intricacies for accurate verification.

To ensure every function in the `ERC1155` contract is annotated with effective formal verification postconditions, we must-align the annotations with the expected behavior of the ERC1155 standard, while addressing the verification error noted for `safeBatchTransferFrom`. Let's focus on accurately and comprehensively articulating these conditions.

Here's the annotated contract:

### Key Points

- **Self-Transfer Handling**: Both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` handle self-transfers (`_from == _to`) to ensure balances remain unchanged, thus preventing issues when verifying that state changes reflect logical expectations in all cases.

- **State Verification in Batch Transfers**: Accurately ensure each element transaction within `_ids` and `_values` is verified for authorization, non-zero balances, decrement from `_from` balance, and increment to `_to` balance for each token index, while keeping proper order.

These annotations ensure the contract meets the expected ERC1155 functionality while addressing the verification errors previously encountered, making the logic robust for both individual and batch transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:19:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments

- **Balance Conditions**: Ensure balances are only modified when `_from` and `_to` are different, handling self-transfers properly by leaving balances unchanged.
- **Length Checks**: Validate that the lengths of the input arrays match (_ids and _values), addressing potential index mismatches.
- **Comprehensive Condition Checks**: Utilize `forall` conditions to ensure that for each transfer in the batch, sufficient balances exist and only then are they decremented from the source and incremented to the target.

This structured verification ensures safety conditions are met while maintaining logical consistency across batch operations. Reworking the approach to capturing these conditions provides a reliable basis for accurate verification per the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:19:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **Balance Assert**: Ensures sufficient funds before each transaction and correct balance adjustments.
  
- **Self-Transfer**: Accounting for if `_from` equals `_to`, balances shouldn't change; transfer posts are conditionally negated in such cases.

- **Batch Order Consistency**: Reflects sequence alignment across indices between `_ids` and `_values` ensuring that conditions hold true for each individual transaction within a batch.

This setup provides comprehensive coverage for the verification needs while aligning with ERC1155 requirements for both individual and batch transfers. This should resolve any verification inconsistencies and meet the intended behavior as per the standard's guidelines.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 06:20:23] ===
To address the verification task for the `ERC1155` contract interface and eliminate the error concerning the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, we need to correctly specify the postconditions to reflect the expected contract behavior according to the ERC standard. In particular, we must ensure that all balance operations for each token in a batch transfer are properly captured.

Below is the properly annotated contract interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

```

### Considerations

- **Balance Checks for Self-Transfers**: The conditions handle the case for `_from` being the same as `_to`, ensuring balances are not decremented.
  
- **Batch Transfers**: `forall` expressions ensure that each index has a sufficient balance before decrementing and correctly increments the receiver's balance.

- **Authorization and Balance Checking**: Ensure that the caller is authorized for token movement (either by ownership or approval) and all balances involved in the transfer hold as expected or do not change when conditions are not met (i.e., self-transfer).

This setup is designed for ERC1155 conformance, ensuring precise handling of transfers (both single and batch).

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:20:52] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To correctly annotate the `ERC1155` contract interface with verification postconditions, careful attention to the detailed balance checks per token transfer is needed, especially in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

### Key Points

- **Balance Assertions**: Ensure there are enough tokens before the transfer begins; the balance conditions before and after transactions are precisely managed and respected.
  
- **Self-Transfer Handling**: Ensures that when `_from` equals `_to`, no changes to balances occur, maintaining integrity on no-op condition.

- **Batch Transfer**: Each element in the batch is checked to ensure starting balances are sufficient, and balances are properly decremented from `_from`, and incremented to `_to` as appropriate.

These specific conditions ensure logical integrity and adherence to the ERC1155 standard, addressing balance flows, authorization, and contract interoperability checks.
