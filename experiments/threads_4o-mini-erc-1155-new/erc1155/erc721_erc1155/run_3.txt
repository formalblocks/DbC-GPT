    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf`**: Postcondition ensures the returned balance is equal to the stored balance for the specified token ID and owner.
  
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Postconditions ensure the returned array of balances corresponds correctly to each (owner, id) pair and that it reflects the current state (`_balances` mapping).

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Postconditions validate the update on `_operatorApprovals` mapping to reflect the approved state for an operator. 

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Postcondition checks that the function correctly returns the approval status from `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensures the target address is not a zero address, as per the ERC1155 standard.
  - Checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
  - Validates that the balance updates occur correctly for sender and recipient addresses unless it's a self-transfer.
  - Checks initial conditions to ensure sufficient balance (`_balances[_id][_from] >= _value`).

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Similar checks to `safeTransferFrom`, extended for batch operations.
  - Ensures lengths of IDs and values match.
  - Each balance in the batch is validated to ensure correct deduction from `_from` and addition to `_to`.
  - Adequate balance checks ensure that no transfer occurs unless balances are sufficient.

These postconditions represent general expectations given the ERC1155 standard and aim to verify state transitions accurately for function calls.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:59:43] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

### Key Aspects Addressed:
1. **Balance Checks and Updates**:
    - Functions `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` include checks that ensure balances do not drop below transferred amounts.
    - Updates are conditional on non-self-transfers, maintaining the same value for self-transfers.

2. **Operator Approval Validations**:
    - Ensures that only approved operators or token owners can make transfers (`_operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _from == msg.sender`).

3. **Length Match for Arrays**:
    - `safeBatchTransferFrom` includes a check to ensure `_ids` and `_values` arrays match in length.

4. **Non-Zero Address Validation**:
    - `_to` address must not be zero to prevent unintended burns or losses.

The annotations correctly implement formal postconditions needed for verification, covering input conditions, state modifications, and adherence to defined standards and invariants of the ERC1155 protocol.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:00:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Aspects:

- **Balance Consistency**: Ensure balances are reduced from `_from` and added to `_to` as per values transferred, maintaining correct balance in self-transfers.
  
- **Approval Checks**: Confirm the caller is either the owner or an approved operator for transfers.

- **Non-Zero Address and Matching Lengths**: Validate that the `_to` address is non-zero and `_ids`, `_values` match in length for batch transfers.

These postconditions should help ensure correct behavior consistent with the ERC1155 standard and resolve any parsing errors from earlier attempts.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:01:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 06:01:45] ===
To resolve the issues with the formal annotations using solc-verify, we need to ensure that postconditions correctly represent logical expressions without syntactic mistakes. Let's provide corrected versions of the postconditions for each function in the ERC1155 smart contract interface.

```solidity

```

### Key corrections and considerations:
- **Logical Conditions**: The logical conditions within postconditions should correctly separate balance checking and assignment. Use arithmetic calculations outside the logical operators (`||` or `&&`).
- **Proper Usage of Syntax**: Each logical statement or calculation should be self-contained and follow the syntax rules for solc-verify.
- **Self-Transfer Handling**: The postconditions for `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` must consider self-transfers where `_from` is equal to `_to`.

These modifications ensure the conditions properly adhere to logical rules, providing a more robust formal verification scheme consistent with the ERC1155 token standard specifications.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:02:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

1. **Balance Retrieval Functions**:
   - `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` ensure that the returned balances align with what is stored in `_balances`.

2. **Approval Functions**:
   - `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` assert that the approval state recorded in `_operatorApprovals` reflects the requested or queried operation.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - `safeTransferFrom`:
     - Checks for non-zero `_to`.
     - Verifies adequate balance from `_from`.
     - Captures the balance decrement from `_from` and increment to `_to`.
     - Confirms that the caller is authorized.
   - `safeBatchTransferFrom`:
     - Adds conditions for matching lengths of `_ids` and `_values`.
     - Ensures balances are sufficiently reduced for all specified token transfers.
     - Complements the conditions for `safeTransferFrom` with batch handling.
  
These annotations assure the correct state transitions and logical behaviors demanded by the ERC1155 standard. The conditions are structured to capture both the constraints and effects on the state variables associated with each function's execution.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:03:08] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation and Key Considerations:

1. **Balance Management**:
   - **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the returned balance strictly equals the stored state in `_balances`.
   - **`balanceOfBatch`**: Confirms that each queried balance matches the state, maintaining consistency between owners and token IDs.

2. **Approval Mechanism**:
   - **`setApprovalForAll`**: Updates the operator approval mapping according to the `_approved` flag.
   - **`isApprovedForAll`**: Postconditions reflect the retrieval of the current approval status.

3. **Transfer Rules**:
   - **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
     - Checks ensure transfers abide by state updates and maintain the sender's initial balance constraints.
     - Handles increases and decreases in `_balances` correctly, with self-transfer conditions handled explicitly.
   - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
     - Verifies length consistency between `_ids` and `_values`.
     - Ensures all operations within the batch adhere to the necessary balance changes and authorization constraints, including verification for insufficient balance.

These annotations ensure that the behavior aligns with ERC1155 standards and verification requirements using solc-verify. They check for the correct balance transitions and approval use within the contract, ensuring integrity throughout operations.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:03:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Corrections and Annotations:
- **Annotation Logic**: Ensures that postconditions reflect the necessary error checks, balance updates, and verification steps that align with the ERC1155 standard.

1. **Balance Retrieval**:
   - `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`: Ensures balances reflect the data in `_balances`.

2. **Operator Approvals**:
   - `setApprovalForAll`: Updates `_operatorApprovals` to accurately reflect approval state.
   - `isApprovedForAll`: Verifies that return matches the expected approval state.
  
3. **Transfers**:
   - `safeTransferFrom`:
     - Consistent balance updates based on transaction success.
     - Handles cases where `_from` and `_to` are the same (self-transfer).
   - `safeBatchTransferFrom`:
     - Validates list length consistency.
     - Manages batch balance checks and modifications, ensuring sufficient balances.
     - Correctly manages state updates for multiple transfers handled in the batch.

The annotations cover the necessary logical conditions and state changes required for each function, creating a reliable verification structure in accordance with ERC1155 contract specifications.

### Explanation:

1. **Balance-related Functions**:
   - `balanceOf`: Ensures the returned balance matches the private state `_balances`.
   - `balanceOfBatch`: Same ensures that for multiple queries, each index of `_ids` and `_owners` reflect the corresponding balance in `_balances`.

2. **Approval Functions**:
   - `setApprovalForAll`: Corrects and updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
   - `isApprovedForAll`: Simply fetches and returns the approval status from `_operatorApprovals`.

3. **Safe Transfer Logic**:
   - `safeTransferFrom` & `safeBatchTransferFrom`:
     - Ensure `_to` is not zero to prevent unintended burns.
     - Verify transaction initiator approval.
     - Include checks for self-transfer scenarios (`_from == _to`), ensuring balances remain unchanged if applicable.
     - Handle `_balances` decrement and increment post-transfers, ensuring no underflow.

These carefully structured postconditions aim to accurately reflect the contract's logic per the ERC1155 standard and address any specified verification constraints effectively.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:05:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

1. **Balance Retrieval**:
   - `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`: Verify that the returned values match the stored balances.

2. **Authorization**:
   - `setApprovalForAll`: Updates the `_operatorApprovals` status, making sure the approval state reflects the requested change.
   - `isApprovedForAll`: Confirms the status of operator approvals.

3. **Transfers**:
   - **`safeTransferFrom`**:
     - Approvals and `_to` checks prevent unauthorized transfers and ensure valid transactions.
     - Handles both changes in balance when `_from` is different from `_to` and scenarios where they are equal (self-transfers).

   - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
     - Validates array length matching for IDs and values.
     - Ensures sufficient balance for each transfer, with constraints managing state during batch processes.
     - Accounts for both conditions when `_from` and `_to` differ or are identical, keeping transactions valid.

These postconditions help ensure that each function's logic is correctly represented, in alignment with ERC1155 standards and verification requirements. This setup ensures reliable contract behavior across diverse operational scenarios.
