=== USER [2025-04-17 05:51:58] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Checks that the returned balance matches the state variable for the given owner and token ID.
- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures the returned batch of balances corresponds to the specific owner/token ID pairs.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping and verifies the change matches the `_approved` parameter.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Matches the result directly with the stored approval status.
- **safeTransferFrom**: Verifies the transfer conditions such as approval status, non-zero recipient address, balance sufficiency, and updates to both sender and recipient balances accordingly.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Introduces additional requirements to ensure consistent array length between `_ids` and `_values`, checks approvals, ensures recipient address validity, and processes each balance operation correctly when transferring batches of tokens.

These annotations are based on the requirements set out by ERC-1155 and should reflect expected behaviors for state changes and conditions under which token transfers and approvals occur.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Let's align the specifications precisely with the ERC1155 standard and correct any issue with the code not implementing actual functions, as the goal is to specify postconditions for formally verifying expected behavior rather than introduce code logic directly in these interfaces.

### Important Points:
- The `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` functions include postconditions that check the balances match the state as expected.
- The `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` annotations ensure changes to or checks against the approval status between owners and operators.
- `safeTransferFrom` includes checks for balance sufficiency and non-zero address requirements, while also updating balances correctly.
- `safeBatchTransferFrom` verifies all constraints related to batch operations such as balance sufficiency, recipient address validity, and consistent lengths of IDs and values arrays, while updating balances correctly.
  
These annotations strictly reflect the ERC1155 behaviors as per the standard configuration, ensuring the integrity of operations within the ecosystem accounting for each function's impact on state variables.

```

### Key Changes:
- The contract ensures that postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` take into account the possibility of `_from` being equal to `_to`, in which case there is no effective change in balances.
- Postconditions enforce requirement checks such as `_to != address(0)`, that the caller is either approved or the owner so that the operation is valid, and that sufficient balance is available before performing the transfer.
- The balance changes (or lack thereof in self-transfer scenarios) are verified, ensuring the mathematical balance integrity is consistent with intended logical operations as per the ERC-1155 specification.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:53:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation
- **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch**: Return values are tied directly to the state of `_balances`.
- **setApprovalForAll and isApprovedForAll**: Ensure approval mappings reflect reality after call.
- **safeTransferFrom**: Checks whether `_to` isn't zero, balance sufficiency, and conforms to self-transfer conditions.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Includes critical checks like `_to` not being zero, array length consistency, and sufficiency of funds for each token type. This ensures balances reflect correct states post-operation, particularly accounting for source-to-target transfers except in self-transfers.

This updated contract should align with formal verification tools by ensuring all necessary states satisfy postconditions reflecting expected functional contracts within ERC-1155 guidelines.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:54:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** The postcondition now ensures that each balance in `ids` for the `from` account is reduced by the appropriate `values[i]`, unless it is a self-transfer (i.e., `_from == _to`).
- **Checks for sufficient balance** are now explicitly stated for each token in the batch, ensuring correctness after the transactions.
- **Self-transfer checks** are included to leave balances unchanged when `_from == _to`.
- **Verify approval**, except for the self-owned case `_from == msg.sender` for all batch transfers.

These postconditions now more accurately reflect the contract's intended behavior, supporting formal verification of compliance with the ERC-1155 standard.

### Explanation:
- **Postconditions** for each function reflect the expected changes to the state variables `_balances` and `_operatorApprovals`, ensuring all necessary conditions are checked post-execution.
- **safeTransferFrom** and **safeBatchTransferFrom** postconditions include checks for valid `_to` address, sufficient balance, and updates based on transfer success.
- **balanceOf** and **balanceOfBatch** relate directly to the state mappings of token holdings.
- Postconditions for approvals ensure the proper state update following changes to operator permissions.
- **Self-transfer handling**: When `_from == _to`, balance changes should net to zero, hence postconditions capture this scenario.

These annotations cover the behaviors expected and improve the consistency of implementation with ERC-1155 definitions, supporting formal specification and potential automated verification processes.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:55:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Key Points:
- **Self-transfer handling**: When `_from` equals `_to`, balances should remain the same, which is captured in the postconditions.
- **Verification of conditions**: The postconditions enforce that only valid transfers (where sufficient balance exists) can occur.
- **Handling approval**: Ensures the caller is authorized via approvals or ownership.
- **Batch operations**: Ensure balance updates consistently reflect batch operations, following arrays' length constraints.
- **Condition consistency**: Applied broadly to both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, ensuring they are consistent across single and batch operations.

This version should resolve and align with the key postcondition requirements, preventing the issues noticed previously with batch transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:56:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:
- **Ensuring balance sufficiency**: Adjusted postcondition to ensure that the `_balances[_ids[i]][_from]` check ensures there is no underflow, indicating no transfers will surpass available balance.
- **Self-transfer Handling**: Preserved balances when `_from == _to`, ensuring they remain unchanged.
- **Correctly Handling Approval**: Postcondition confirms that the caller is approved or the owner.
- **Batch Transfer**: Ensures balances are managed properly across all indexes of the batch, with the condition aligning successfully with different paths based on the zero address and array length checks.

These postconditions should ensure proper adherence to the expected behavior standards while effectively cross-verifying balance changes or confirmations across related token transactions.
