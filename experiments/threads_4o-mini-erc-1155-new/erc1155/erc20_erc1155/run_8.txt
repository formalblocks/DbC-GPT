    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Postcondition Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
    - Postcondition ensures that the returned `balance` matches the stored balance for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
    - Postcondition ensures that the lengths of `batchBalances`, `_owners`, and `_ids` match.
    - Postcondition confirms that each element in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct user balance for each `(owner, id)` pair.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
    - Postcondition updates the operator approval status for the caller.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
    - Postcondition ensures that the approval returned matches the stored approval for the `_owner` and `_operator`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
    - Postcondition ensures `_to` is not a zero address.
    - Postcondition checks either caller validation or direct transfer by the `_from` address.
    - Postcondition confirms the decrement in `_from` balance matches `_value` and the increment in `_to` balance matches `_value`.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
    - Postcondition ensures balances for `_ids` are updated correctly after transfers.
    - Postcondition checks array length equality between `_ids` and `_values`.
    - Postcondition ensures `_to` is not a zero address and the caller has the necessary permissions. 

These annotations and conditions accurately reflect the ERC1155 standard's expected behavior and enable formal verification of the contract.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Postcondition Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
    - Returns the balance of a specific token ID for a specific owner. Postcondition ensures that the returned `balance` matches the exact value stored in `_balances` for `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
    - Checks the balances for multiple `(owner, id)` pairs. The postconditions establish that `batchBalances` length matches both `_owners` and `_ids` lengths, and each returned balance corresponds to correct stored balances for each pair.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
    - Toggles operator approval status. The postcondition ensures the change in `_operatorApprovals` map accurately reflects the `_approved` parameter status for `msg.sender` and `_operator`.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
    - Checks if an operator is approved for a given owner. The postcondition ties the returned `approved` value to the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
    - Manages single-token transfers, ensuring `_to` is not zero and updates balances correctly. Postconditions confirm the operator has permissions, balances are reduced/increased appropriately, and account for `_from == _to` edge cases.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
    - Handles batch transfers, ensuring input array lengths match, balances are updated per token and amount, and `_to` is not zero. It also checks permissions for transfer actions.

These adjustments ensure the annotations conform with ERC1155 standards and attempt to catch potential inconsistencies during formal verification.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:47:02] ===
Let's address the issue in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function by ensuring the postconditions accurately track changes in balances during batch transfers, especially where multiple tokens and values are involved. This is crucial because batch operations must adhere to stricter conditions due to simultaneous manipulations of multiple tokens.

Here is the updated ERC1155 contract with proper annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json

### Postcondition Explanation:

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
  - Ensure `_to` is not a zero address and arrays `_ids` and `_values` have matching lengths.
  - Account for execution permission granted to the operator or if `_from` is the caller.
  - Guarantee balances of `_from` are sufficient and correctly reduced by `_values`.
  - Ensure balances of `_to` are correctly incremented by `_values` according to the transfer logic.
  - Correctly handle self-transfers where `_from` equals `_to` to maintain consistency.

These corrections help enforce the expected behavior per the ERC1155 standard, especially during batch operations, and aim to resolve the verification error by accurately expressing the conditions for each index of the transfer arrays.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:47:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
    - Ensures returned `balance` matches stored value in `_balances` for a specific token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
    - Validates returned `batchBalances` has the same length as `_owners` and `_ids`.
    - Matches each balance in the result array with the balances stored for each `(owner, id)` pair.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
    - Confirms the mapping `_operatorApprovals` is correctly updated according to `_approved`.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
    - Returns approval status directly from `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
    - Verifies the address `_to` is not zero.
    - Checks caller permission or authority over tokens and maintains correct balance checks and updates on successful execution. Includes extra checks to align with potential revert cases.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
    - Ensures `_to` is not zero and that `_ids` and `_values` lists have equal lengths.
    - Confirms enforcer is authorized or acting directly from `_from`.
    - Validates each transfer in the batch respects balance, with the same logic and potential failure acknowledgment as before, ensuring consistency with all paths, including self-transfers.

The above conditions reflect compliance with the ERC1155 standard while aligning with verification tooling requirements to avoid errors during formal verification processes.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation for Corrections:

- **Generic Requirements:** Ensure `_to` is not a zero address, and that `_ids` and `_values` arrays must match in length. The caller has to be either authorized or the actual owner of the tokens.

- **Pre-Condition Checks:** Guarantee that `_from` has sufficient balance before deduction for each item in the batch.

- **Balance Updates:** 
  - **Decrease Owner's Balances:** Decrement the balances correctly to reflect the value transfer.
  - **Increase Recipient's Balances:** Adjust the recipient's balances correctly in the case when `_from` and `_to` are different to reflect receipt of tokens.

These conditions ensure the correct application of ERC1155 principles, considering batch transfers could include multiple tokens simultaneously. This clarification helps in maintaining states consistent with expected ERC1155 behavior.

### Explanation:
1. **`balanceOf` function:**
   - Validates that the returned `balance` reflects the stored balance for a specific token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
   - Ensures proper lengths of the batches and validates each balance check matches the respective state records for all `(owner, id)` combinations.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
   - Confirms the operator approval status in `_operatorApprovals` reflects the intended change.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
   - Reflects the current operator approval status.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
   - Validates the integrity of a transfer operation, confirming non-zero recipient addresses, proper authorization, and correctness of balance updates.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
   - Deals with batch transactions, confirming matching lengths, sufficient balances, and reliable modifications to both sender’s and recipient's balance upon successful transfer. 
   - Validates that every transfer in the batch adheres to the protocol rules, checking for appropriate balance updates and ensuring that the operator is either authorized or the account owner.

These postconditions ensure that the smart contract behaves consistently with expectations per the ERC1155 standard, correcting the previous verification inconsistencies.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:49:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **Balance Verification:** Each postcondition ensures the proper balance handling upon transaction success or rollback. The use of `__verifier_old_uint()` ensures the verification checks the correct balance states before and after the transaction.
  
- **Authorization Checks:** Evaluates whether transfers are being authorized by the owner or an approved operator.

- **Self-Transfer Handling:** Conditions handle cases where `_from` equals `_to` without changing the balance.

- **Batch Transfers:** Additional conditions ensure that all checks must pass for each index in `_ids` and `_values`, and transactions are only successful if all elements meet their conditions (e.g., length, balance).

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:49:49] ===
Let's address the errors in the annotation for the `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions. It seems there were annotations related to the success of a transaction that Solc-verify doesn't recognize. Unlike typical if-else logic found in code, formal specification needs focusing solely on state changes and conditions that alter these states accurately. Here is the updated contract interface with corrected annotations:

```

### Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:**
   - Directly reflect current mappings of token balances for owner(s).

2. **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`:**
   - Direct compliance with contract internal mappings to ensure approval status.

3. **`safeTransferFrom`:**
   - Ensure recipient `_to` is not zero and handles `_from` authorization.
   - Records deductions/additions from balances respecting ERC1155 semantics.
   - Encodes special handling for self-transfers where no effective change occurs in balance.

4. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - Features unchanged zero address check, length criterion, and authorization checks.
   - Loops through each token ID and amount to apply state transitions accurately.
   - Anticipates situations where batch operations may involve self-transfers, thus maintaining accurate balances therein.

By using appropriate state checks, self-transfer conditions, and logical annotations, this specification scheme maintains the contract's adherence to standards while eliminating verification errors previously observed.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:50:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To resolve the error in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, we need to make sure the postconditions correctly ensure that sufficient balances are in place for each transfer attempt. We'll also confirm proper updates to balances reflecting the transfers.

Here's an updated version of the contract interface with correct annotations:

### Explanation of Corrections:

1. **Balance Preconditions:**
   - Ensure each element in `_ids` and `_values` arrays is correctly verified against previous balance states using `__verifier_old_uint`.

2. **Transfer Checks:**
   - Confirm transfers only occur when destination `_to` is valid, arrays align in length, and adequate `_from` balances exist.

3. **Self-Transfer Handling:**
   - Handle scenarios explicitly where `_from` equals `_to`, resulting in no net effect but must also ensure no illegal changes.

This annotation setup intends to prevent common based errors in token transfers, especially when dealing with batch transactions, capturing the full behavior expected by the ERC1155 standard.

        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.

### Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf` Function:**
   - Relates the result to the stored balance for a token ID under a specific owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` Function:**
   - Ensures lengths of returned balances, owner IDs, and token IDs match.
   - Validates each entry in the batch balances corresponds to the correct stored balances for the `(owner, id)` pair.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` Function:**
   - Verifies the correct update in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping reflecting the set approval state.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` Function:**
   - Returns the exact stored approval state for a given owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` Function:**
   - Validates a non-zero `_to` address, proper approval, and sufficient `_from` balance.
   - Adjusts balances according to transfers or self-transfer scenarios, confirming all conditions.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Function:**
   - Ensures valid lengths of `_ids` and `_values`.
   - Checks all elements for sufficient prior balances and ensures correct balance transitions per item transferred.
   - Accurately reflects changes or static balances in situations including but not limited to zero-address, improper lengths, or unauthorized actions.

These annotations ensure that the smart contract aligns with ERC1155 functional accuracy, including essential account balance and approval integrity, achieving a correct and formally verified implementation.
