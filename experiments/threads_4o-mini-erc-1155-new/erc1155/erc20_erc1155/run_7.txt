    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:39:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```
In the `safeBatchTransferFrom` postconditions, I corrected the error by ensuring that the condition known to fail actually reflects the requirement of having sufficient balance before subtracting values from `_from`. The postconditions now include checking for the requirement that balances be sufficient for batch transfers and correctly updated after the transaction. This adjustment should help meet the intended verification goals.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:41:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

In this updated code, I have made sure that the postconditions are well-defined. I also corrected the order of conditions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected state changes and verify the sufficiency of balances for batch transfers. By addressing these points, the postconditions now more closely mirror the intended function behavior as defined in the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:41:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

In this corrected version:

1. Added checks to ensure balance calculations take into account scenarios when `_from` equals `_to`, covering self-transfers where balances shouldn't change.
2. Kept correct checks for sufficient balances before transfers in `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`.
3. Kept the length checks for `_ids` and `_values` consistent with the ERC1155 specifications.

These changes should meet the requirements of the formal verification system, ensuring safe state transitions and correctness per the ERC standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:42:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:42:24] ===
Here's how you can add formal verification conditions for the given smart contract interface based on the ERC-1155 standard. The problem found in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function seems to be related to ensuring that balances are properly verified and managed during batch operations. I will address these issues and provide the necessary postconditions.

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

### Key points of adjustment:

- For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, ensure that each balance change in the batch is accounted for with `__verifier_old_uint` to account for old state values before subtraction or addition.
- Ensured that the length of both `_ids` and `_values` are equal to avoid mismatched indices.
- Postconditions should explicitly validate sufficient balances before performing deductions for each ID and value pair.
- Consistent handling of `_from` and `_to` addresses to ensure that they are valid and the batch transfer considers them in context. 

This annotation ensures that the formal contract specification captures the intended ERC1155 functionality while satisfying the verification tool requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:42:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations Added:

- **Balance Checks:** Ensure there's enough balance in `_from` before transferring. This logic is reflected in the precondition using `__verifier_old_uint`.
  
- **Self-Transfer:** Specified special handling when `from == to` to ensure balances don't erroneously change in that case.

- **Approval Checks:** Added conditions ensuring either sender is the from or is approved for spending their tokens.

- **Batch Logic:** Ensured consistency in handling batch transfers: `_ids` and `_values` arrays must match in length and order.

These postconditions should ensure the functions behave according to the ERC1155 standard, satisfying a formal verification system by linking the state changes with post-execution assertions.

### Explanation of Key Changes:

- **`balanceOf`** and **`balanceOfBatch`**: Captured relationship with the `_balances` mapping, ensuring that the return values (`balance`, `batchBalances`) reflect the current state.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Postcondition reflects the change in `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the sender and the specified `_operator`.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Directly relates the result to `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`** and **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Validate that the receiver is not a zero address.
  - Ensure the caller is approved or is the owner.
  - For batch transfers, check that `_ids` and `_values` arrays are the same length.
  - Ensure the transfer correctly updates balances by comparing with `__verifier_old_uint` to capture pre-transfer conditions.
  - Special handling for when `_from` equals `_to` to avoid unnecessary balance changes.
  
These annotations, integrated with the relevant verification helper constructs, ensure the expected behavior aligning with ERC1155 specifications while addressing potential verification tool requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:44:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Aspects of Annotations:

- **Balance Validation:** Ensure that sufficiency of balances is validated before deducting them, which addresses potential issues in the `safeBatchTransferFrom`.

- **Array Length Checks:** Ensure arrays `_ids` and `_values` have the same length in `safeBatchTransferFrom`.

- **Approval & Authorization:** Conditions ensure that the sender is authorized to transfer on behalf of `_from`.

- **Address Check:** Address validity (`_to != address(0)`) is highlighted to prevent transfers to zero addresses.

- **Self-Transfer Handling:** Properly accounts for scenarios where `_from` is the same as `_to`.

These structured postconditions help establish that the function behaves as per the expected state modifications, following the ERC-1155 specification, while also ensuring consistency within the contract's logic.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:44:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Characteristics and Considerations:

1. **View Functions:**
    - `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`: Postconditions ensure that the balance retrieved corresponds directly to state mappings `_balances`.

2. **Authorization Handling:**
    - The `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` functions ensure appropriate changes and checks in operator approvals.
   
3. **Safe Transfer Operations:**
    - Both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` include conditions for recipient checks (`_to != address(0)`), authentication checks, and pre-transfer balance verifications.
    - Manage successful execution with `__verifier_old_uint` for pre-state value checks ensuring correct deductions or additions.
    - Carefully structured logical or (`||`) operations for success or failure capture.

4. **Length and Consistency:**
   - Batch lengths must be identical in `safeBatchTransferFrom`.

5. **Smart Contract Recipients:**
   - Functions are expected to appropriately interact with smart contracts when required.

These postconditions effectively communicate expected behaviors, closely aligning functions with both the intended standard and logic consistency to facilitate verification.
