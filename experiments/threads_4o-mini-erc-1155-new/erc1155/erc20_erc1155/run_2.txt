    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with `solc-verify` postconditions, follow these guidelines, ensuring accuracy and consistency across functions. Let's address each function's postconditions appropriately:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**

    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

```

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf`** and **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Directly relate the returned balance with state variables.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**:
  - Ensure that operator approval status is set correctly and the event is emitted.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**:
  - Ensure the returned value reflects the operator's approval status.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Check necessary approvals and address validity.
  - Ensure funds are only adjusted if the transaction is successful with appropriate balance checks and event emission.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but extended to handle arrays of token IDs and values.
  - Ensure length equality between `_ids` and `_values`.
  - Ensure correct fund transfer for each specific token ID using a similar methodology for success checks and state updates. 

This setup will ensure that all the postconditions are verified and consistent with the expected behavior as outlined in the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:29:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- **Postconditions for `balanceOf`**: It ensures the returned balance is exactly what is stored in `_balances` for the provided `_owner` and `_id`.

- **Postconditions for `balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures the return length and integrity relation between balances and owners/ids arrays.

- **Postconditions for `setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that after execution, the operator approval status matches the desired `_approved` status for the caller.

- **Postconditions for `isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the function's return reflects the internal approval state.

- **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`**: 
  - Ensures `_to` isn't the zero address.
  - Ensures caller has approval (unless transferring from their account).
  - Ensures the sender has enough balance.
  - Updates balances correctly following a successful transfer.
  - Addresses self-transfer condition (where `_from == _to`).
  
- **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
  - Follows similar checks as `safeTransferFrom` but iteratively for each index, ensuring integrity between paired `_ids` and `_values`.
  - Validates that lengths of arrays are equal, reflecting the requirement that each `_id` must have a corresponding `_value`.

Each modification ensures alignment with the behavior expected per the ERC-1155 standard while providing annotations that enable formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:30:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**

        MUST revert on any other error.
        MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0).

    */
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Preconditions in Postconditions**: Ensure no transfer occurs to the zero address and that the caller is authorized.
- **Balance Checks**: Ensure the sender's balance is sufficient for the transfer in each applicable function and correctly update the sender's and receiver's balances.
- **Length Matching**: In `safeBatchTransferFrom`, ensure that `_ids` and `_values` have equivalent lengths.
- **Identity Cases**: Consider identity situations where `'_from'` is equal to `'_to'`, requiring distinct handling to ensure balances remain unaltered.

These updates are structured to meet the expected requirements per ERC-1155 while satisfying solc-verify's constraints.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:30:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:30:40] ===
Below is the corrected version of the ERC1155 contract with properly formatted `solc-verify` annotations for each function. The postconditions aim to capture the expected behavior as described by the ERC-1155 specification:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {
    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

### Explanation:
- **Single Transfers** (`safeTransferFrom`):
  - Ensures `_to` isn’t the zero address.
  - Confirms if the caller is authorized (`msg.sender` should be either the owner or approved operator).
  - Validates and appropriately adjusts sender and receiver balances, considering possible failure through `success`.

- **Batch Transfers** (`safeBatchTransferFrom`):
  - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but accommodates arrays of token IDs and amounts.
  - Ensures arrays `_ids` and `_values` match in length and performs batch operations correctly – iterating through each index to apply checks and updates.
  - Implements safety checks for each transfer in the batch, ensuring balances change only if successful.

This specification is designed in accordance with the behaviors stipulated by the ERC-1155 standard. Make sure that `solc-verify` is used with a consistent configuration to support the verification properly.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:31:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:31:04] ===
Let's address the contract and define proper postconditions for each function, ensuring they adhere to the ERC-1155 standard and are compatible with `solc-verify` requirements. The main issue revolves around using an undeclared 'success' identifier, which should be managed with or without conditional terms based on assumed outcomes or provided interfaces.

Here's the corrected ERC1155 specification:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
        /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    */
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs
        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token types requested (i.e. balance for each (owner, id) pair)
        /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
        /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _ids.length
        /// @notice postcondition forall(uint x) !(0 <= x && x < batchBalances.length) || batchBalances[x] == _balances[_ids[x]][_owners[x]]

    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /**

        @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
        @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
        @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
        /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
        /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**
        @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
        @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
        MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
        MUST revert on any other error.
        MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

        /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) || (_balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value)
    */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**
        @notice Transfers `_values` amount(s) of `_ids` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
        @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
        MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.
        MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.
        MUST revert on any other error.
        MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        @param _from    Source address

    */
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

**Explanation of main changes:**

1. **Balance Checks**: For both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, ensure the `__verifier_old_uint` balance is sufficient before transferring and adjusting balances after transfer. Handle self-transfer (where `_from == _to`) separately, ensuring the balance remains accurate if not properly conducted.

2. **Postcondition structure**: Fixed conditions based on preconditions, considering that the function should revert otherwise (if conditions not satisfied).

3. **Use Declarative Language for Conditionals**: Adopt correct, formal language using quantifiers (like `forall`) for iterations over arrays.

The contract annotations are structured to allow `solc-verify` to check the correctness of both single and batch token transfers according to expected behavior defined by the ERC standard. Run the verification process and ensure configurations are aligned with these assumptions.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:31:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:31:35] ===
To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with `solc-verify` postconditions, it's essential to clearly define conditions that reflect the expected behavior based on the ERC-1155 standard. Here's an updated version of the contract including appropriate postconditions for each function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);

**Explanation:**
1. **`balanceOf`**: The function returns the balance for a specific token ID and owner, directly mapping to `_balances[_id][_owner]`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The function ensures that the output length matches both input arrays (`_owners` and `_ids`) and that each balance is accurately reflected, iterating through each pair.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: This sets the operator's approval status, verified by ensuring `_operatorApprovals` reflects the correct state.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: It verifies and returns the current approval status of an operator for a specified owner.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**: These ensure that the `_to` address is valid (not `0`), that the function only proceeds if balances are sufficient, and that `_from` is approved to make the transfer. They adjust balances accordingly only when all conditions are satisfied.

Ensure that these postcondition annotations are used with `solc-verify` configured correctly, as they are designed to reflect behaviors demanded by the standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:31:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
- **View Functions**:
  - Ensure outputs directly reflect current state values by relating the return values to the contract’s internal state.

- **Approval Functions**:
  - Confirm statuses such as approvals must be consistent in their settings and query functions.

- **Transfer Functions**:
  - Validate essential conditions for address and authorization checks.
  - Manage balance updates for straightforward and batched transfers while incorporating self-transfer handling for consistent behavior across function executions.

The annotations should be run with `solc-verify`, which will analyze validity and correctness against these defined conditions, ensuring that functions behave correlated to their declared ERC-1155 roles.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:32:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 05:32:21] ===
For adding proper annotations suitable for `solc-verify`, let’s handle each function of the ERC1155 smart contract interface with the prescribed accuracy and syntax. Below is the contract with the correct annotations, ensuring conformity with the ERC standard and considering the guidance provided:

```solidity

### Explanation:
1. **Balance View Functions:**
   - `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` ensure the internal mapping state reflects the returned balances.

2. **Approvals:**
   - `setApprovalForAll` updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping to match the `_approved` parameter.
   - `isApprovedForAll` simply returns the status of approval for the specific pairs.

3. **Transfer Functions:**
   - `safeTransferFrom` checks that transfers are not made to the zero address, requiring sufficient balances and appropriate authorization.
   - `safeBatchTransferFrom` handles multiple transfers, ensuring array length matching, sufficient balances, and correct account updates.
   
These annotations aim to provide the necessary conditions and states an ERC-1155 contract should maintain, providing clarity and reliability checks for each method in the contract using formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-17 05:32:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To correctly annotate the given ERC1155 contract interface with `solc-verify` postconditions, we should ensure each function follows the ERC-1155 standard and verification guidelines. Let's address the issues you've encountered and set the proper postconditions for formal verification:

### Explanation:
- **View Functions** (`balanceOf`, `balanceOfBatch`): Annotations ensure that the output matches the underlying state variables of `_balances`.

- **Approval Management**: `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` update and confirm the `_operatorApprovals` mapping, respectively.

- **Token Transfer Functions**:
  - **`safeTransferFrom`**:
    - Adequately checks address validity and operator approval.
    - Ensures balance sufficiencies before the transfer.
    - Verifies balance adjustments for both `_from` and `_to`.
  - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
    - Verifies the precondition checks, such as arrays length.
    - Applies balance checks and updates iteratively over tokens in `_ids`.

These postconditions are created to ensure the safety, accuracy, and correctness of functions based on the ERC1155 standard, enabling formal verification through `solc-verify`.
