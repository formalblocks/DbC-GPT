=== USER [2025-04-16 17:27:39] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations cover the expected behavior based on ERC-1155 standards for balance checks, approval management, and transferring tokens, using appropriate verification syntax.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:28:08] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance corresponds exactly to the current balance stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that the length of returned balances matches the length of inputs and that each balance returned matches the respective balances in `_balances`.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: After execution, ensures the `_operatorApprovals` state reflects the provided `_approved` value. Emits the ApprovalForAll event as required.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Guarantees that the function returns the current approval state from `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
    - Ensures `_to` is not a zero address.
    - Validates there is enough balance to transfer.
    - Handles self-transfers: if `_from` == `_to`, balances should remain unchanged.
    - When sender is different from the recipient, verifies balances update accordingly and event emission.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
    - Ensures `_to` is not a zero address and the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
    - For each index `i`, ensures that enough balance is available for transfer.
    - Handles self-transfers like `safeTransferFrom`.
    - Verifies correct application of balance changes for each token identifier and checks the emission of the TransferBatch event. 

These postconditions correspond to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-1155 standard. The annotations should ensure the contract behaves as intended, both in terms of logical execution and in emission of the required events.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:29:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To properly annotate the given ERC1155 contract functions with formal verification postconditions, we need to make sure the behavior outlined in the ERC-1155 standard is being adhered to and is consistent across the implementations. I'll annotate each function according to these guidelines:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

```

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the function returns the current balance for the specified `_owner` and `_id` as stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that for each index `i`, the balance returned for each `(_owner[i], _id[i])` pair matches the internal state, and the lengths of the returned array match the input arrays.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that after the function execution, the `_operatorApprovals` mapping reflects the newly set approval status. The function must emit an `ApprovalForAll` event when a change occurs.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status directly reflects the value stored in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
    - Validates that `_to` is not the zero address.
    - Checks that the balance of `_from` is not less than `_value` before the transfer.
    - Updates balances for both `_from` and `_to` if they are different, otherwise, it asserts the balances remain unchanged.
    - Emits `TransferSingle` event upon successful transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
    - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
    - Verifies that the length of `_ids` matches `_values`.
    - Updates balances using batch logic (for each index `i`) and ensures that batch transfers reflect changes correctly.
    - Emits `TransferBatch` event if there is a successful batch transfer.

These annotations denote specific conditions according to the standard ERC-1155 behavior, ensuring the correct mapping and state transitions throughout the execution of the contract's functions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:29:49] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:29:52] ===
To provide formal verification postconditions for the given ERC1155 smart contract functions, we'll annotate each function according to the behavior expected by the ERC-1155 standard. The postconditions will ensure that changes in state variables are consistent with the function's logic and the standard requirements. Below is the contract with added solc-verify annotations:

### Key Points:

1. **balanceOf**: Provides a straightforward postcondition ensuring the returned balance is equal to the stored balance for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Checks that the result array's length matches the input and each balance corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the approval mapping and emits an event reflecting this change. Handles success by ensuring event emission occurs only if the operation succeeds.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies that the function return status matches the mapping value indicating whether the operator has approval.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - Validates that `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures sufficient balance exists for transfer.
   - Handles self-transfers and correctly updates balances and emits the `TransferSingle` event.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Validates that `_to` is not the zero address and both input arrays match in length.
   - Ensures each transfer in the batch meets requirements, updates balances properly, and emits the `TransferBatch` event. 

These postconditions capture the logical guarantees provided by each function, ensuring consistency with the ERC-1155 standard and appropriate state updates within the contract.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:30:19] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition verifies that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the given token ID and owner address.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that the output array length matches the input length, and each balance aligns with stored balances in `_balances`.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status in `_operatorApprovals` is updated correctly and the corresponding event is emitted.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Checks that the returned status corresponds to the actual approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: This function has postconditions checking:
   - `_to` is a valid address.
   - The balance `_from` is sufficient for the transfer.
   - Self-transfers maintain the same balance.
   - Correct balance adjustments and event emission.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Postconditions ensure:
   - Validity of `_to` and array lengths.
   - Each balance check is done before transfer and each balance is updated appropriately per `ID`.
   - If `_from == _to`, balances remain unchanged.
   - Correct event emission reflecting changes.

These postconditions align with the expectations for managing ERC-1155 tokens and ensure that transitions between states within the smart contract are accurately captured.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:30:48] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Verifies that the displayed balance corresponds to the stored balance in `_balances` for a specific owner and token ID.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Checks that the length of the balance array matches the input owner and ID arrays and that each balance matches the stored values.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that `_operatorApprovals` matches the specified approval state and that the event is emitted upon success.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the return value accurately represents the approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **safeTransferFrom**:
  - Confirms basic conditions like nonzero `_to` address and sufficient balance.
  - If the transfer is successful and `_from` differs from `_to`, balances are updated.
  - Handles self-transfers without balance changes.
  - Emits a `TransferSingle` event for a completed transfer.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Validates that `_to` isn't zero, and lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
  - Confirms sufficient balance for each transfer and updates balances unless self-transfers occur.
  - Emits a `TransferBatch` event for a successful batch operation.

These postconditions ensure clarity and adherence to the contract's logic and the ERC standards, allowing for meaningful and enforceable verification of the contract's behaviors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:31:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the balance returned is consistent with the stored value in `_balances`.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures the returned array `batchBalances` matches the input arrays' lengths, and balances align with stored values.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures after execution that `_operatorApprovals` reflects the updated approval status and emits the necessary event.

- **isApprovedForAll**: The postcondition verifies the method correctly returns whether `_operator` is approved by `_owner`.

- **safeTransferFrom**:
  - Checks that `_to` is not a zero address, balance is sufficient, or the success condition fails.
  - Updates balances if `_from` is not equal to `_to` and succeeds, and emits the `TransferSingle` event.
  - Ensures if `_from == _to`, balances should remain unchanged.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Verifies that `_to` is not the zero address and that array lengths match, or the success fails.
  - If successful, updates the balance for each index provided in `_ids` and `_values` unless it is a self-transfer.
  - Emits the `TransferBatch` event for verification of changes across all token types.

These annotations provide rigorous conditions that adhere to the standard requirements for ERC1155 functionality, ensuring each function operates within its expected parameters and state transitions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:31:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the function returns the existing balance from the mapping.

- **balanceOfBatch**: Checks the lengths of input and output arrays are consistent, and the batch balances match the stored account balances.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the function updates the approvals correctly and emits the relevant event.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the return value reflects the actual approval status stored in the contract.

- **safeTransferFrom**:
  - Handles conditions like non-zero `_to` addresses and sufficient balance.
  - Updates balances respecting whether it's a self-transfer (no change) or to others.
  - Emits the `TransferSingle` event on a successful transfer.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Validates conditions such as non-zero `_to` addresses, matching lengths of `_ids` and `_values`, and sufficient balances.
  - Ensures each transfer is processed correctly and events reflect these changes.

These annotations ensure that the contract will function consistently with the expectations set forth by the ERC-1155 standard and allow for formal verification of compliance with those standards.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:32:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf**:
    - Ensures the balance returned matches the stored balance in the mapping `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
    - Checks that the output array length corresponds to the input array lengths and each balance matches the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
    - Ensures the approval mapping is updated correctly and verifies that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
    - Confirms that the return value matches the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
    - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
    - Checks that `_from` has enough balance.
    - If `_from` != `_to`, the balances are updated correctly, and the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.
    - In the case of a self-transfer, ensures the balance remains unchanged.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
    - Ensures that `_to` is not the zero address and input array lengths are the same.
    - Verifies that all transfers are valid and updates balances accordingly, emitting the `TransferBatch` event.
    - Handles self-transfers properly.

These annotations help enforce that contract functions perform as expected, per ERC-1155 standards, by checking preconditions, postconditions, and emitted events.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:32:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

            }
        }
        emit TransferBatch(msg.sender, _from, _to, _ids, _values);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf**:
    - Verifies that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
    - Ensures the length of `batchBalances` matches `_owners` and `_ids`.
    - Checks that each balance in the batch equals the value stored in `_balances`.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
    - Verifies that the approval status is updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
    - Confirms that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
    - Confirms that the function returns the correct approval status as indicated by `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
    - Checks that `_to` is not the zero address.
    - Verifies that `_from` has sufficient balance.
    - Ensures balances are updated correctly and the `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly; handles self-transfers effectively.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
    - Checks that `_to` is not the zero address and array lengths match.
    - Confirms every balance in the transfer is sufficient and balances are updated correctly; handles self-transfers well.
    - Emits a `TransferBatch` event on successful transfer.

These postconditions follow the ERC-1155 standards and ensure the smart contract's functionality is formally verified for correct behavior.
