=== USER [2025-04-16 17:33:28] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To formally specify postconditions for each of the functions in the given contract according to the solc-verify syntax, we need to provide annotations that describe the expected behavior of each function in terms of the state variables and parameters involved.

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the returned balance matches the internal mapping.
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Verifies the length of the returned balances array matches the input arrays, and the balances for each `(owner, id)` pair.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms the operator's approval status for the caller matches the provided boolean `_approved`.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Checks that the returned approval status correlates with the internal mapping.
- **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures the postconditions on balances are satisfied following a successful operation, and checks the non-zero address condition for `_to`.
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but verifies arrays' matching lengths and orderly processing of batch transfers including non-zero address condition.

These annotations provide a formal description of what each function delivers or modifies, helping verify the contract's correctness.

### Key Changes:

- **Correct Syntax**: Corrected the syntax for the `forall` quantifier to align with the expected format for expression predicates in annotations.
- **Success Clause**: Adjusted conditions to remove annotations related to `success` since `success` is implicitly guaranteed via event emissions and revert behavior.
- **Functional Consistency**: Ensured postconditions reflect state changes accurately according to ERC1155 standards for each function, leveraging function parameters and state variables for annotations.
- **Address Checking**: Provided the necessary conditions to validate that balances update correctly post-transfer.

These annotations aim to accurately capture the contract's expected behavior following the ERC1155 standard, ensuring that each function's execution yields a valid state transition or result.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:34:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

### Explanation:

- **View Functions**: The view functions `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` have postconditions that relate their return values directly to the respective state variables.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Reflects the update on the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the sender and operator.
- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensure that the balance is updated appropriately after the token transfer.
  - Handle special conditions for self-transfer where `_from` equals `_to` implicitly.
- **Batch Transfer**: Includes conditions to reflect the decrements and increments of balances for each token in a batch transfer.

By using proper syntax and ensuring semantic correctness as per the ERC1155 standard, these annotations aim to capture the expected behavior and validate contract correctness during execution.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:34:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To effectively add formal verification conditions to the ERC1155 smart contract and comply with the standards, let's address the encountered errors and ensure proper formatting and logical representation of postconditions. 

The annotations will ensure that function calls result in appropriate state transitions according to the ERC1155 standard. Let's correct the annotation syntax and postconditions for each function.

### Notes:

- **View Functions (`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`)**: The postconditions provide a direct correlation between the return value and internal state variables, following the parameters. This ensures that results accurately reflect current token balances.
  
- **Approval Function**: When managing approvals, changes in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping are tracked for clarity of state effects.

- **Transfer Functions**:
  - **Self-Transfer Handling**: Ensures conditions specifically address non-self transfers (`_from != _to`), reflecting correct balance changes.
  - **Balance Verification**: Uses `__verifier_old_uint` to verify balances accurately before and after the token operations, ensuring correctness in validation.
  - **Preconditions for Transfers**: Contains conditions to prevent transactions that should revert, such as sending to the zero address or mismatched arrays.

By ensuring precision in these specifications, the annotations help in formally verifying the behavior desired by the ERC1155 standard for each respective function. The corrected annotations aim to address previous errors while providing logically sound conditions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:35:25] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

1. **Annotations Syntax**: Corrected syntax errors in the `forall` statements to ensure compatibility with the verification tool.
  
2. **Balanced Transfer**: For `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, annotations ensure tokens are systematically deducted from the source and added to the target, confirming non-zero target addresses.

3. **Consistency**: Maintained consistency with ERC1155 standards, ensuring that the operations reflect correct state changes and expected behaviors.

4. **Operator Approvals**: Ensured conditions check for appropriate operator approval, allowing the function to proceed only if those approvals are in place.

These changes aim to capture each function's intended state modifications and constraint checks as defined in the ERC specifications, while also ensuring compatibility with formal verification tools.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:35:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: Ensure that return values are directly related to the `_balances` mapping.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms the operator approval status for the `_operator`.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Reflects the approval status in the return value directly from `_operatorApprovals`.
- **`safeTransferFrom`**: Handles different cases, including self-transfers, successful operations, and failures, while ensuring the `_to` address is non-zero.
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Ensures the transfer reflects correct decrements and increments in balances, respects array length constraints, and retains batch order correctness.

These annotations aim to prevent execution under undesirable conditions and assure the function logic comprehensively aligns with the ERC-1155 specification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:36:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:36:16] ===
To ensure correct formal verification for the ERC1155 smart contract interface, we must accurately annotate each function with appropriate postconditions that comply with the standards and syntax of solc-verify. Here's the corrected version of the smart contract with the necessary postconditions annotated correctly:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _ids.length == _values.length

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Key Highlights of the Postconditions:

- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: Ensure the return value is directly related to the `_balances` mapping, confirming correct balance retrieval.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms approval status for an operator is updated appropriately in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Verifies if an operator is approved by checking consistency with `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensure that a non-zero `_to` address is checked.
  - Preserve the logic of successful and unsuccessful transactions with conditions covering both scenarios.
  - Ensure balances adjust correctly after transfers and account for self-transfers where applicable.

The annotations are set to capture key conditions of ERC1155 transactions, reflecting adherence to the specified behavior and constraints of the standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:36:44] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To adjust the annotations so they comply with the expectations of formal verification and the ERC1155 standard, let's make sure the postconditions are correctly formatted and semantically accurate. This involves correctly capturing the balance states and respecting the syntax used by the verification tool.

Here's a revised version of the contract with proper annotations:

```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

### Explanation:

- **Indexing**: Ensured annotations use valid syntax by clearly specifying the loop indices for forall expressions.
  
- **Balance Assertions**: Updated expressions to ensure consistency with expected state changes, handling success and failure cases properly. The logic confirms balance adjustments only occur on successful operations where the `_to` is not `_from`.

- **Consistency**: All functions now reflect their transactional changes both in terms of state updates and conditions for failure. 

- **Array Conditions**: Ensures the lengths of arrays match to provide safe iteration over associated pair elements—essential for batch operations.

This structured approach ensures logical consistency and comprehensive coverage of the operations and attributes expected from ERC1155 functions based on the standard's stipulations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:37:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

The errors noted in the previous step are due to the incorrect syntax used for the `forall` quantifiers in the annotations and also the incorrect handling of logic for success and other identifiers mismatches. Let's redefine and correct these annotations for the `ERC1155` contract to fit with the specification requirements:

### Corrections Explained:

- **Forall Statements**: Corrected the syntax by replacing the `=` in the loop declaration.

- **Logical Conditions**: Updated to include handling for the condition when the transfer should not proceed due to a failed requirement or a self-transfer condition (where no changes should occur).

- **Non-Zero Address Constraint**: Explicitly ensured `_to` is non-zero as a standalone clear condition for intended transactions.

- Ensure that the batch verification handles consistency with the array lengths, aligning with the ERC1155 standard requirements. Also, verification logic handles potential overlapping of `_from` and `_to`.

These changes ensure that each contract function respects constraints and logic essential for maintaining the intended smart contract behavior as per the ERC1155 specification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:37:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's correct the annotations in the `ERC1155` smart contract to eliminate errors and ensure compliance with the ERC standard. We'll focus on rewriting the expressions for logical clarity and correctness as per the verification guidelines:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.

    */

    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens

    */
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

### Key Corrections and Updates:

- **`forall` Syntax**: Correctly used the range notation in the `forall` statement.

- **Logical Conditions**: Improved conditional logic to ensure correct relations for success or failure scenarios, especially controlling for self-transfers and ensuring consistent balances.

- **Success Control**: Logic avoids explicit use of an undeclared `success` identifier, focusing directly on conditions that imply transactional execution.

- **Non-Zero Constraint**: The conditions properly ensure that `_to` is always non-zero.

- **Batch Transfer Verification**: The loop checks now follow standard syntax for logical assertions within the verification tool.

These annotations are structured to provide robust and consistent postconditions verifying the contract's expected behavior as per the ERC-1155 standard requirements.
