=== USER [2025-04-16 17:44:37] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:44:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **`balanceOf`:** The function returns the balance for a specific token ID for a given owner. The postcondition directly maps the returned balance to the `_balances` mapping.

- **`balanceOfBatch`:** Requires two parameters (arrays of addresses and token IDs) having equal lengths and then associates balances for each pair, ensuring that function returns correspond to the mapping state.

- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Sets an operator's approval status for managing an account's tokens. The postcondition reflects that approval status for the operator updates accordingly.

- **`isApprovedForAll`:** Confirms whether an operator is approved for the provided owner by mapping directly from state variables.

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** Postcondition checks that if tokens are successfully transferred, the balances reflect the changes (decrementing the sender, incrementing the receiver while also considering self-transfer cases).

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Stringently checks the lengths of identifiers and value arrays; similarly maintains balance updates for each ID-value pair as in `safeTransferFrom` but in batch processing.

This formal verification ensures that functions operate duly in line with expectations of the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:45:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Corrections

- Proper syntax like `==>` was used in postconditions with `forall` in annotations to denote implications, which previously had incorrect formatting.
  
- Postconditions are correctly formatted to ensure they directly relate pre-state values to post-state values using `__verifier_old_uint` where necessary, and they incorporate correct logic for balances and approvals.

- Added clarification for correct use of `==` versus `==>` in guidelines and assertion. 

These changes adhere to ERC standards and guarantee contract behavior respects expected functionality post-conditions with accurate state reflection.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:45:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Correct Annotations

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the returned balance is exactly what is stored in the `_balances` mapping for a given `_owner` and `_id`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Checks that the lengths of the returned array and the input arrays match and that each returned balance corresponds to the correct values in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping is updated to match the `_approved` value for the specified operator.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms that the returned `approved` status matches what is stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**: Validates that the `_balances` accounting reflects a decrease in `_from` and an increase in `_to`, with special handling when `_from` equals `_to` (self-transfer).

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Ensures that input array lengths match and reflects batch changes in `_balances`, decrementing from `_from` and incrementing for `_to`. It also handles cases when `_from` equals `_to`.

This contract now includes correctly-formulated postconditions consistent with the intended behaviors defined by the ERC1155 specification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:46:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Adjustments

- **Logical Assertions**: Ensure the use of correct logical syntax with forall quantifiers specifying integer types explicitly: `forall (int i)`.
  
- **Consistency in Addressing**: Ensure annotations refer precisely to the ERC-1155 functional requirements, consistently connecting state variables pre- and post-function execution using `__verifier_old_uint`.

- **Verification Syntax**: Correct the format in postconditions to use logical implications to express conditions effectively using `==>`.

This version correctly uses the require and expected logical syntax for formal verification compatibility.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:46:43] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To add formal verification annotations correctly to this smart contract, it's crucial to ensure the proper use of logical quantifiers and expressions according to the solc-verify specifications. Let's correct the annotations in the ERC1155 contract functions:

### Changes and Reasoning

- **`balanceOfBatch` Annotation**: A corrected syntax for `forall` quantifier was used to ensure conditions can be applied correctly iterates across array elements.
  
- **Avoiding Invalid Syntax**: Removed parentheses around `forall` statements, placing them directly as conditions.

- **Logical Statements**: Each annotation correctly uses logical conditions to reflect state changes and conditions adherence.

These annotations ensure formal verification reflects the essential behaviors defined by the ERC1155 standard, meeting standards of operation and predictable state continuity.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:47:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:47:10] ===
To add formal verification annotations to the ERC1155 contract correctly, it's essential to ensure that the postconditions match Solidity syntax for logical expressions and utilize the solc-verify standard appropriately.

Here's how to annotate the contract functions with relevant postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs
        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token types requested (i.e., balance for each (owner, id) pair)
    */
    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length && _owners.length == _ids.length
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; i++) batchBalances[i] == _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /**

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
    */
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /**

        @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to `onERC1155Received` on `_to`
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) ? (_balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value) : true
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**
        @notice Transfers `_values` amount(s) of `_ids` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).

        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
        MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.
        MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.
        MUST revert on any other error.
        MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc.).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g., code size > 0).

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Key Adjustments

- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Corrected the syntax for stating the postcondition with iteration logic using `forall`.

- **`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Updated logic to handle self-transfers (`_from != _to`) with a conditional operator for balance changes; applied iterations over `_ids` for batch transfers.

- **Logical Constructs**: Used `?` for ternary conditional operations consistent with formal specifications for optional self-transfer handling.

These postconditions, using proper logical constructs and annotations for each function, align with ERC-1155 expectations and enable accurate formal verification of the contract's state transition behaviors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:47:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:47:38] ===
To fix the syntax errors in solc-verify annotations, we need to provide the correct verification annotations for each function. These annotations should use the appropriate quantifier syntax and logically express the expected state transitions according to ERC-1155 standards.

Below is the corrected version of the contract with appropriate postcondition annotations.

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g., https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json

### Explanation
- **Quantifier Corrections**: `forall` syntax is corrected to specify correctly iterated and bounded `i` without unnecessary tokens.
  
- **Self-Transfer Handling**: In conditions like `_from == _to`, no deduction is applied for balance decrement logic.

- **Validation with Old State**: `__verifier_old_uint` correctly refers to previous state values for comparison to new balances, ensuring postconditions are relatable to state changes occurring in each function call. 

These annotations are structured to adhere strictly to the requirements per the ERC-1155 standard and solc-verify instructions, ensuring consistency and logical correctness of smart contract functionality.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:48:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation
- **Quantifiers**: Correct use of `forall` with logical implications `==>` which ensures for each index `i`, specific balance conditions hold true.
  
- **Logical Statements**: Logical conjunctions `&&` and disjunctions `||` are used for expressing combined conditions in each postcondition. This format is essential, especially for cases like self-transfers (`_from == _to`).

- **Check Conditions**: Ensures no deductions for self-transfer while state balance updates correctly reflect as needed both before and after transfer functions. 

These postconditions now should compile correctly under solc-verify and provide proper state transformations following each function execution consistent with ERC1155 specifications.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:48:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:48:43] ===
To resolve the syntax errors and adhere to the solc-verify tool guidelines for smart contract verification, we need to carefully apply the correct syntax for quantifiers and logical expressions. Here's the corrected contract with appropriate postcondition annotations:

### Explanation
- **Quantifiers and Conditions**: `forall` is utilized correctly to ensure all elements within specified indices comply with the stated conditions.
  
- **Logical Expressions**: Distinct conditions for balances when `_from` equals `_to` (self-transfer) accounted for using logical disjunction `||`. This handles both transfer and non-transfer scenarios gracefully.

- **Postconditions**: Ensure postconditions properly reflect contract state changes, supporting both successful and self-transfer operations consistent with ERC standards.

This configuration rectifies previous syntax errors and ensures proper logical construction for verifiability using solc-verify.
