=== USER [2025-04-16 17:23:04] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Each function is annotated with postconditions that describe the expected changes to the contract's state, conforming to the ERC-1155 standard. These annotations assist in formal verification of the correctness of the contract functions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:23:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

The key changes are:

1. Changing the loop syntax in the postconditions for `balanceOfBatch` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` to use `forall (uint i; i < ...; )` which aligns with the correct syntax expected by solc-verify.

2. Ensuring consistent use of __verifier_old_uint around state variable references within postconditions.

This should resolve parsing errors when using solc-verify annotations for verification of the contract.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:24:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Corrections:
- Adjusted the `forall` syntax to be compatible with solc-verify by explicitly specifying the range within the condition (`0 <= i && i < _length`).
- Ensured proper logical conditions across all functions for formal verification purposes.

This should resolve the syntax errors and enable solc-verify to parse the annotations correctly.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:24:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes:
- Corrected the `forall` syntax in postconditions by using `i >= 0 && i < _length` in the conditions to define the range.
- Ensured that the annotations accurately reflect the expected behavior described in the ERC-1155 standard, maintaining consistency between related functions and correctly using state variables.

This approach should resolve the parsing errors related to the formal verification annotations with solc-verify.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:24:48] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

It appears that there was a syntax mistake in the previous postcondition annotations. Let's correct the syntax errors by ensuring that the `forall` condition annotations match the expectations of solc-verify. Let's take another pass at the annotations:

### Key Changes:
- Corrected the syntax for `forall` to use commas: `forall (uint i; condition)` aligns with the solc-verify expectations.
- Ensured logical conditions accurately match the ERC1155 specification in terms of describing permissible state changes and initial validations.

This should address parsing issues and provide valid postconditions for verification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:25:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:25:15] ===
It looks like there's an ongoing issue with the syntax for the `forall` constructs in the postconditions. The proper syntax for use within solc-verify for quantifiers like `forall` does not include a semicolon `;` within the quantifier's conditions. Let's adjust the syntax accordingly and correct the error in the annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    string private _uri;

```

### Key Adjustments:
- Removed the semicolons that were incorrectly placed within the `forall` syntax.
- Ensured that the annotations align correctly with the solc-verify expectations, making sure each precondition and postcondition precisely describes the state changes according to ERC-1155 standard. 

This updated syntax should resolve the parsing issues and provide the intended verification conditions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:25:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

It seems the syntax for the `forall` quantifier is still incorrect according to the expectations of solc-verify. Let's correct the syntax for quantified expressions and ensure the conditions are accurately described.

Here is the corrected contract with formal annotations:

```solidity

### Key Corrections:
- The `forall` quantifiers are now using correct syntax with `forall (uint i)` followed by the condition axis `(condition) ==>`.
- Added clarification in annotations for variable and range checks that align with the ERC-1155 specification ensuring consistent state changes under specified conditions. 

These adjustments aim to ensure compliance with expected solc-verify syntax and correct property definitions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:25:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

It seems I was mistaken in my interpretation of the syntax for `forall` annotations in solc-verify. Let's adjust the syntax to avoid the mistaken use of `==>` without a correct precondition. 

Here is a corrected version of the contract with annotations suitable for solc-verify:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

### Key Adjustments:
- Reformulated the `forall` syntax to use a proper quantification over the indices of the arrays for precise indexed operations.
- Correctly stated the postcondition relating to the comparisons between previous state values and post-transaction states for the `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions. 

This syntax should be more aligned with the expectations of solc-verify and provide clear verification that aligns with ERC-1155 or similar standards.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:26:45] ===
It seems that there are issues with the postcondition annotations for `balanceOfBatch` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`. These issues often arise from incorrect assumptions about the post-state values or the order and lengths of data arrays. Let's fix those postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions.

Here’s how the contract could be annotated with proper verification conditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json

### Key Changes:
- Updated `balanceOfBatch` postconditions to ensure they map and compare correctly over the provided arrays.
- Corrected `safeBatchTransferFrom` to ensure the condition reflects the balance changes for each id and value pair.

These adjustments should better align the postconditions with the expected behavior as outlined in ERC-1155 specifications and compatible for solc-verify processing.

The error messages you're seeing indicate a syntax issue in the `forall` annotation. The goal is to correctly specify quantifiers in the postconditions that match solc-verify's expected syntax. Let's address these errors by making sure the annotations are valid.

Here’s a revised version of the contract annotations for proper formal verification:

```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

### Key Changes:
- Replaced `forall (uint i) (condition)` syntax with `forall (uint i in 0 .. length)` to comply with expected loop indexing in Solc-verify syntax.
- Made sure each postcondition aligns with the assumptions each function holds, ensuring the state is clearly described as per the token's transfer rules.

This should help avoid parsing errors and provide clarity, ensuring postconditions reflect possible state changes after each function call.
