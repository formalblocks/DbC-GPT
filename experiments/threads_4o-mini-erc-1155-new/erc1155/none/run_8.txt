=== USER [2025-04-16 17:49:03] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations add postconditions ensuring that each function adheres to the ERC-1155 standard specifications, with particular focus on changes to the `_balances` mappings and ensuring that events are emitted as required. The conditions account for both successful and unsuccessful execution states, reflecting the expected behavior of each function.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:49:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These postconditions correctly enforce the expected outcomes specified by the ERC1155 standard. They ensure that balances are updated accordingly upon successful transfers and that contract events are emitted as required. Conditions also confirm that input length requirements are met and that balances are sufficient before transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:49:57] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **View Functions**: 
  - `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` read the balances based on account and ID combinations, directly reflecting state mappings without altering them.

- **Approval Management**:
  - `setApprovalForAll` updates the mapping for operator approvals and emits the `ApprovalForAll` event.
  - `isApprovedForAll` checks if an operator is approved for a particular owner.

- **Transfers**:
  - `safeTransferFrom` ensures non-zero target addresses and sufficient balance before transferring, adjusting balances accordingly, and emitting a `TransferSingle` event.
  - `safeBatchTransferFrom` requires equal length of ID and value lists, verifies each balance before transferring, updates balances, and then emits a `TransferBatch` event.

These postconditions and checks reflect typical safety measures and expected state transitions for an ERC1155 implementation, helping ensure contract logic correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:50:30] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **`balanceOf`** and **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Ensure balance retrieval is consistent with the `_balances` mapping state prior to function calls.
  - Conditions enforce that return values are derived directly from state variables.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**:
  - Confirm that `_operatorApprovals` reflects the updated approval status.
  - Logically link the function behavior with the `ApprovalForAll` event emission.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**:
  - Directly relate the approval check to the current status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensure that if the function executes without error, the `_to` address is non-zero and balance changes reflect the transfer.
  - Emphasize event emission on condition of a successful transfer.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Validate array length matches and confirm the adequacy of balances before enabling batch transfers.
  - Guarantee that post-transfer balances correctly adjust and `TransferBatch` or `TransferSingle` events are emitted as necessary.

These postconditions are crafted to cover typical safety checks and expected state modifications, aligning with standardized contract behaviors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:50:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **`balanceOf`** and **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Correspond to querying balances directly from `_balances`, ensuring return values reflect the current state.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**:
  - This ensures that the `_operatorApprovals` state reflects the new approval status.
  - The emitted `ApprovalForAll` event confirms approval changes.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**:
  - Validates that the return value matches the stored state in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Checks that for successful execution, the `_to` address isn't zero, accounts for self-transfers by comparing `_from` to `_to`, and ensures balance adjustments are correct. 
  - For self-transfers, the balance should remain unchanged.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Similarly ensures array length agreement, addresses non-zero, and corrects balances only when successful.
  - Ensures handling of each transfer in the batch with appropriate balance deductions and increments.

By clarifying these specifications, we ensure compliance with the ERC-1155 standard, facilitating formal verification and logical correctness in expected operations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:51:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **balanceOf** and **balanceOfBatch**:
  - Reflect exact balance inquiries from `_balances`, ensuring return values match the state.

- **setApprovalForAll**:
  - Confirms toggle in `_operatorApprovals` state and emits `ApprovalForAll`.

- **isApprovedForAll**:
  - Verifies that the approval status complements the current value in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **safeTransferFrom**:
  - Validates non-zero target addresses and sufficient available balances, and confirms balance updates or self-transfer stasis.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Ensures correct addresses, matching array lengths, valid balance adjustments if successful, and calls appropriate event procedures.

Each postcondition targets the ERC-1155 protocol's operational expectations, facilitating logical checks and their correlation with smart contract state under each function's operations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:52:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **balanceOf**:
  - Confirms that the returned balance directly matches the user's balance in `_balances`.

- **balanceOfBatch**:
  - Ensures array lengths match and batches the balances correctly for each `(owner, token ID)` pair.

- **setApprovalForAll**:
  - Reflects the updated approval status in `_operatorApprovals` and emits the `ApprovalForAll` event.

- **isApprovedForAll**:
  - Confirms the return value directly matches the state in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **safeTransferFrom**:
  - Verifies non-zero target address, sufficient balances for transfer, and balance updates for success, adjusting for self-transfer scenarios.
  - Emits a `TransferSingle` event after a successful transfer.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Ensures correct param length, target address non-zero check, updates balances correctly only on success and handles self-transfer case to maintain balance.
  - Emits a `TransferBatch` event after a successful batch transfer.

All function specifications are aimed at safeguarding state integrity and compliance with the ERC-1155 standard, providing a clearer path for formal verification processes.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **balanceOf**:
  - The postcondition confirms that the function returns the correct balance by directly equating it to the balance stored in `_balances`.

- **balanceOfBatch**:
  - Ensures the length of outputs matches that of inputs and confirms each output correctly reflects balances from `_balances`.

- **setApprovalForAll**:
  - Changes the approval status of an operator in `_operatorApprovals` and requires an event emission to signal this change.

- **isApprovedForAll**:
  - The postcondition matches the return value with the current authorization status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **safeTransferFrom**:
  - Checks that the `to` address is non-zero, relevant balances are debited/credited appropriately on success, and emits a `TransferSingle` event.
  - Accounts for self-transfers which should leave the balance unchanged.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Ensures non-zero target address, matching ids and values lengths, and alters balances if all conditions are met. Self-transfers should also maintain balance.
  - Calls for emission of `TransferBatch` events when successful.

These annotations protect integrity consistent with ERC-1155 standards, mapping behavior expectations directly into the modelchecked context.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:53:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **`balanceOf`**:
  - The function ensures that the balance of the specified `_owner` and `_id` matches the value in `_balances`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Validates that the lengths of `_owners` and `_ids` are equal and matches the result.
  - Checks that all balances returned match the expected balances in the `_balances` mapping.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**:
  - Ensures that `_operatorApprovals` is updated correctly.
  - Requires the relevant event to be emitted for a successful action.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**:
  - Ensures that the return value matches the current approval status for the `_operator`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensures the `_to` address isn't zero.
  - Adjusts balances only if the transfer is successful.
  - Includes an event emission for successful transfers.
  - Specifically checks self-transfers to ensure balances remain unchanged.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Requires non-zero `_to` address and equal lengths of `_ids` and `_values`.
  - Checks that all the respective balances are correctly updated on success.
  - Handles self-transfers to ensure balances stay unchanged.
  - Checks for the emission of the correct event after a batch transfer.

These conditions ensure compliance with the ERC-1155 standard and help in verifying the correctness of each function and the overall contract behavior.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:53:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **`balanceOf`**:
  - Ensures that the balance returned for a given `_owner` and `_id` matches the stored value in `_balances`.

- **`balanceOfBatch`**:
  - Confirms that the returned batch balances relate directly to the `_balances` state variable for each respective `(owner, id)` pair and that the inputs have matching lengths.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**:
  - Reflects changes in `_operatorApprovals` corresponding to the `_approved` status.
  - Emphasizes the requirement to emit an `ApprovalForAll` event when set.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**:
  - Confirms that the return value matches the actual approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Validates that the `_to` address is not zero, prevents illegal transfers, and checks correct balance deductions and increments on success.
  - Self-transfers are examined to ensure no balance change.
  - Ensures `TransferSingle` is emitted for each successful transfer.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Requires `_to` to be non-zero and checks balance updates and array consistency between `_ids` and `_values`.
  - Ensures balances are adjusted correctly for successful transfers and checks self-transfer conditions.
  - Emphasizes that `TransferBatch` is emitted reflecting all changes.

These postconditions guide formal verification to ensure that the contract complies with ERC-1155 behavior.
