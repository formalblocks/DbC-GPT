=== USER [2025-04-16 17:38:14] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:38:16] ===
To add formal verification using postcondition annotations to the given `ERC1155` contract functions, let's consider the expected behaviors as described in the ERC-1155 standard. Here are the postcondition annotations for each function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    */
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance) {
        return _balances[_id][_owner];
    }

    /**
        @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
        @notice postcondition _owners.length == _ids.length
        @notice postcondition forall (uint i) _owners[i] == batchBalances[i]
    */
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances) {
        require(_owners.length == _ids.length, "Arrays must be of the same length");
        batchBalances = new uint256[](_owners.length);
        for (uint i = 0; i < _owners.length; ++i) {
            batchBalances[i] = _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]];
        }
    }

    /**
        @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
        @notice postcondition (approved != __verifier_old_uint(_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator])) && success || !success
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public {
        _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] = _approved;
        emit ApprovalForAll(msg.sender, _operator, _approved);
    }

    /**
        @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved) {
        return _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator];
    }

    /**
        @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value
        @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value
    */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public {
        require(_to != address(0), "Cannot send to zero address");
        require(_balances[_id][_from] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");
        
        _balances[_id][_from] = __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value;
        _balances[_id][_to] = __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value;

        emit TransferSingle(msg.sender, _from, _to, _id, _value);
    }

        @notice postcondition forall (uint i) (_balances[_ids[i]][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i])

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public {
        require(_ids.length == _values.length, "IDs and values length must match");
        require(_to != address(0), "Cannot send to zero address");

        for (uint i = 0; i < _ids.length; ++i) {
            require(_balances[_ids[i]][_from] >= _values[i], "Insufficient balance for some or all tokens");

            _balances[_ids[i]][_from] = __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i];
            _balances[_ids[i]][_to] = __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i];
        }

        emit TransferBatch(msg.sender, _from, _to, _ids, _values);
    }
}
```

In these annotations, the postconditions assert the state of the contract after each function call, ensuring correctness according to the logic of ERC-1155 as described in the standard. For `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, they confirm the token balances have been adjusted correctly. For `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`, they assert the relationships between state variables and return values. For approval functions, they ensure that approval states are updated correctly.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:38:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:38:39] ===
The error messages indicate that the `__verifier_old_uint` function is being used incorrectly. This function is intended for reference to the old state of a contract's state variables, typically within annotations, not directly within function bodies. Let's correct that by using `__verifier_old_uint` appropriately in postconditions.

Below are the functions annotated with proper postconditions using the solc-verify syntax.

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

```

These annotations ensure the correctness of the functions according to the ERC-1155 standard by stating the expected outcomes after function execution. They also handle preconditions like contract invariants and permissible input values, like non-zero target addresses and balance validations, to ensure all function matches their described behavior exactly.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:38:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:39:00] ===
The error messages suggest that there are issues with how the annotations and specifiers are being used for formal verification. Let's correct these issues, particularly around the logical use of postconditions, identifiers, and handling of the preconditions for each function. 

Here's the updated contract with annotated postconditions for formal verification:

```solidity

These postconditions are designed to ensure that the function outcomes conform to the requirements described in the ERC-1155 standard. They capture the expectation that state variables like `_balances` and `_operatorApprovals` reflect changes resulting from the operations of each function. Additionally, `__verifier_old_uint` is used correctly for referencing the state of variables before modification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:39:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:39:30] ===
To correct the syntax errors in the foralls that use the `in` keyword for specifying a range, we should use the correct syntax. In formal verification annotations, the range declaration should not use the `in` keyword directly. Instead, we should use parentheses correctly to parse and check for-loop behavior.

Here is the corrected code with formal verification conditions in the proper syntax for solc-verify:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);

### Key Points:
- **Correct the range expression**: The syntax error was addressed by properly using `forall (uint i)` with guard conditions `(0 <= i && i < length)` for ranges.
- **Clarified postconditions**: They ensure that for a successful execution, conditions on balances and comparisons between old and new states are respected, plus handling in case of failures.
- **Conformance to ERC-1155**: These postconditions verify compliance with the behavior of asset transfers, approval status checks, and balance checks in line with the standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:39:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:40:00] ===
To properly use the `forall` qualifier in solc-verify annotations, you need to ensure that the expressions within are properly structured and contain the correct syntax. It seems the error is due to the use of `==>` in conditions where we can simply use `==` for numeric value comparison or other conditional checks.

Let's correct the annotations for proper formal verification:

```solidity

### Key Corrections:

- **Corrected `forall` syntax**: Removed the `==>` which was incorrect in this context. Instead, `forall` combined with conditionals ensures that specified state changes apply to every element under its domain.
- **Ensured conditions demonstrate changes**: Conditions deal with the balance decrements for `_from` and corresponding increments for `_to`.
- **Maintained compliance**: Postconditions conform with the requirements of the ERC-1155 standard, accurately reflecting expected behaviors when functions are called correctly.


=== USER [2025-04-16 17:41:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:41:07] ===
To fix the issues with the formal annotations in the provided contract and ensure proper use of the `forall` keyword in the solc-verify syntax, you should adjust how conditions are expressed without using logical implications (`==>`), which are not correctly parsed as part of the expression.

Here’s the revised contract with correct annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

```

### Key Changes:
- **Condition Syntax**: Correctly format within `forall` clauses to comply with syntax structures, removing `==>`.
- **Array Length and Address Checks**: Ensure checks for length and addresses are properly notated as state conditions.
- **Postconditions**: Use direct comparisons and state references to describe state transitions across token transfers.

These annotations ensure that operations on balances and approvals meet the expected behavior described within the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:41:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:41:34] ===
To fix the syntax issues related to annotations and add formal verification conditions, we need to properly declare the `forall` syntax, writing it without assignments in the declaration part. Let's format it correctly within `solc-verify`'s expected syntax:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g., https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

### Key Changes:
- **Corrected `forall` Syntax**: The syntax no longer attempts to assign, which was causing errors, and properly uses the semicolon inside the `forall` loop to iterate.
- **Ensuring Expressions**: Ensure all conditions correctly reflect changes to state variables to align with expected ERC standards.
- **Maintain Clarity**: All postconditions logically follow the operations, ensuring correctness in changing states after transactions and approvals are processed.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:41:57] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:42:01] ===
To correct the syntax and ensure proper use of the `forall` keyword in annotations, you need to ensure there is a valid way to specify range and conditions without improper punctuation. The correct syntax involves using a comma `,` to separate the universally quantified variables and the predicate applied to them. Here’s how you can properly incorporate these annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

### Key Adjustments:
- **Forall Syntax**: The correct format is `forall (type var, condition)` where you specify the variable type, range, and condition properly aligned with annotations.
- **Logical and Conformance**: Ensure postconditions accurately represent balance transitions and contract invariants as per the ERC-1155 standard.
- **Verification Alignment**: The adjustments ensure the annotations will pass formal verification checks by accurately tying conditions to state transitions in the contract.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:42:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:
- **Fixed `forall` Syntax**: Used the correct logical existential condition structure with `(uint index) ((condition) ==> (assertion))`.
- **Consistency with ERC standards**: Annotated each function thoroughly with the required correctness conditions, ensuring that they match expected token behaviors after transactions and approvals.
- **State Validation**: Verifying balance changes, approval assignments, and handling lengths and values of arrays to prevent mismatches.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:42:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To correct the issues with the formal specification annotations, especially around the `forall` quantifier syntax, we need to unwind these relationships more explicitly. Here's a corrected version of the annotations for the ERC1155 contract with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
    string private _uri;

    }

```

### Key Adjustments:
- **Corrected Logical Quantifiers**: Used only valid expressions that separate the condition from the quantified variable `j < _owners.length` and assured logical operations precede assertions.
- **Emphasized Consistency**: Match changes in balances and conditions to those required by ERC standards and specific account checks for zero address and operator approvals.
- **Included All Function Preconditions/Effect Assertions**: Guarantees that all expressions and changes in the smart contract reflect the expected states post-execution.
