=== USER [2025-04-17 04:31:25] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This specification correctly adds postconditions to each function of the ERC1155 smart contract according to the ERC-1155 multi-token standard requirements. The postconditions ensure the contract's correctness in situations involving balance queries and token transfers, along with handling approvals.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:31:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Based on your task of adding formal verification conditions, I'll provide the necessary "solc-verify" postconditions for each function of the ERC1155 interface, aiming to ensure that these conditions match the expected behavior of the ERC-1155 standard. Let's refine the postconditions accordingly:

This updated specification includes appropriate postconditions that reflect expected state changes or assertions based on inputs and existing state variables, following the ERC-1155 standard. The fix for the error ensures that batch transfers correctly assert that the old state had sufficient balance for each component of the transfer.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:32:25] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These postconditions handle all the necessary aspects outlined by the ERC-1155 standard, making sure to capture the specified preconditions such as ensuring addresses are not zero and that balances are adjusted correctly. The solution involves tracking the balances before and after transactions and enforcing condition checks for approvals and valid transfers.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]

To annotate the functions of the `ERC1155` contract interface with appropriate formal verification conditions, we'll add postcondition declarations that reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard.

### Key Postconditions:

- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:** Ensures the view functions accurately reflect the state of `_balances` for the specified owner and token IDs.

- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Confirms that `_operatorApprovals` for a given operator is set correctly for the caller.

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** 
  - Validates the `_to` address is not zero.
  - Checks that the caller is authorized either because they are `_from` or because they have approval.
  - Verifies that the `_from` has a balance equal to or greater than `_value`.
  - Ensures balances are updated accordingly: deducting from `_from` and adding to `_to`.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
  - Ensures the same length requirement for `_ids` and `_values`.
  - Validates each transfer in the batch to ensure sufficiency of balance.
  - Properly adjusts the balances for each transferred token from `_from` to `_to`.

This specification should ensure the desired consistency across function contracts, as aligned with the ERC-1155 standard.

### Breakdown of Changes:
- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:** The balance view functions confirm that the return values match those stored in `_balances` for the requested owners and token IDs.
  
- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Validates that the operator's approval status aligns with the input after execution.

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** Handles transfer constraints and ensures the balance changes correctly reflecting the amount transferred.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
  - Checks that arrays `_ids` and `_values` have the same lengths.
  - Ensures each element within the batch can be transferred without violating balance constraints.
  - Updating balances for each element is validated, ensuring it's correctly reflected in the mappings.

These conditions should lead to successful verification if the logic and actual implementation respect these specifications and abide by ERC-1155 standards. The error in `safeBatchTransferFrom` could have been due to a misinterpretation of balances or array sizes; these postconditions should address that concern by ensuring sufficient pre-transfer balances.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:34:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Breakdown
- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:** Correctly assert the relationship between return values and state variables.
  
- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Ensures the operator approval status is consistent with the `_approved` argument for the caller after execution.

- **`isApprovedForAll`:** Asserts that the return value reflects the current approval status.

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** Includes additional handling for self-transfers to ensure when `_from` equals `_to`, balances are unchanged. This conforms to requirements in the original task's guidelines for handling self-transfers.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Checks are in place to ensure all batched transfers meet preconditions related to array length and balance constraints before updating balances. Also includes self-transfer checks to ensure balances remain unchanged in those cases.

These postconditions are devised to maintain consistency with the ERC-1155 standard behaviors while capturing the essential logic for verifying correctness regarding typical transfer and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:34:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Highlights:
- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:** Ensure balances reflect the actual stored state in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Confirms operator approval settings are successfully modified.

- **`isApprovedForAll`:** Provides correct approval status in return value.

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** Validates permissions and balance, ensuring that transfers are appropriately accounted for. Handles self-transfers by ensuring balances remain unchanged where appropriate.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Confirms array lengths match, validates balance sufficiency for all elements in batch, and adjusts balances accordingly, handling self-transfers correctly.

These verified postconditions ensure each function adheres to the expected behaviors outlined in the ERC-1155 standard while providing a basis for formal verification that accounts for value transfers, approvals, and proper function execution consistency.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:35:15] ===
Based on the task of adding formal verification postconditions for each function in the ERC1155 contract interface, we will accurately specify the expected state changes. Let's focus on ensuring these conditions conform to the ERC-1155 standard and correctly handle self-transfers, ensuring all guidelines on variable usage and naming are followed. Here is the updated contract with added postconditions:

```solidity

```

### Adjustments Made:
- **For `safeTransferFrom`:** Included special handling to account for self-transfers (i.e., when `_from == _to`). If a transfer is a self-transfer, balances remain unchanged.
  
- **For `safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Similar logic applies to each element in the batch transfer, verifying that each individual transfer either respects balance constraints or is a self-transfer. 

These annotations are designed to capture every expected state transition and constraint required by the ERC-1155 specification, focusing on ensuring adequate balances before transfers and reflecting correct state changes, including zero-address checks and lengths alike, ensuring thorough safety and consistency across contract operations.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:35:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To add formal verification conditions to the ERC1155 smart contract interface, we will use the solc-verify syntax to annotate each function with appropriate postconditions that capture the expected changes in the contract's state. These annotations will ensure the contract behaves according to the ERC-1155 standard. Here's how to annotate each function with solc-verify postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

}
```

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:** The postconditions ensure the view functions reflect the accurate balances as recorded in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Verifies that the approval state is updated as specified by the `_approved` argument.

- **`isApprovedForAll`:** The postcondition matches the returned value to the approval state in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** Validates that `_to` isn't a zero address, checks that the caller is authorized, and verifies balance changes only if `_from` differs from `_to`. Special handling for self-transfers preserves the balance.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Ensures lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match, verifies preconditions and balance changes for each transfer in the batch, and incorporates logic to prevent breaking invariant when `_from` equals `_to`.

These conditions are structured to provide clarity and correctness as required by the ERC guidelines, with special attention to self-transfers and batched operations, resulting in comprehensive post-definitions to establish verified correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:36:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To add formal verification postconditions for the functions in the ERC1155 smart contract interface per the ERC-1155 standard, we'll need to annotate each function with precise postconditions using the solc-verify syntax.

### Key Points Explained:
- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:** Postconditions ensure that return values are consistent with the stored balances in `_balances`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Ensures that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping is updated as expected to reflect the provided approval status `_approved`.

- **`isApprovedForAll`:** Guarantee that the function's return value accurately reflects the current state of approval.

- **`safeTransferFrom`:** Checks that the address `_to` is valid and non-zero, that the caller is authorized, verifies whether the balance is sufficient (unless it's a self-transfer), and then ensures that both source and destination balances are updated correctly as long as it is not a self-transfer.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** Similar safeguards as in `safeTransferFrom` but applied to batch transfers, ensuring for each item in `_ids` and `_values`, relevant checks and updates are duly made while considering array lengths and balances.

These postconditions are crafted to conform to the ERC-1155 standard behavior and ensure the functions correctly modify the contract's state as expected. The verification should succeed barring extraneous implementation errors elsewhere in a complete contract integration.
