=== USER [2025-04-17 04:25:53] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations ensure compliance with the ERC-1155 standard and provide a formal guarantee of the expected behavior of each function through symbolic execution and static analysis.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:26:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:26:25] ===
To address the verification error and ensure the contract's postconditions align with the ERC-1155 standard, we must carefully analyze and adjust the postconditions for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. The existing postcondition error indicates that the condition regarding the sender's balance (`_balances[_ids[i]][_from] >= _values[i]`) may not hold after the function execution.

Let's revise and enhance the postconditions for all functions, emphasizing the particular issue identified in `safeBatchTransferFrom`:

```solidity

```

In the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, postconditions ensure the target address is not zero, validate authorization/consent for the transfer, and confirm consistent balances before and after the transaction across all indices. These adjustments align with ERC-1155's required behavior for batch operations, taking into account the necessary checks for efficient transfer management.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:26:58] ===
To address the verification issue in `safeBatchTransferFrom` regarding the balance checks, we need to ensure the postconditions correctly reflect the expected behavior. The key is to confirm that the sender's balance for each token type is adequately verified before any deductions occur.

Here are the updated postconditions for the `ERC1155` contract functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    string private _uri;

    /**

}
```

Key changes:

- **Self-transfers account:** Postcondition ensures that balance checks might be bypassed for self-transfers where `_from == _to`, adapting for a scenario where the transfer doesn't change balances.
- **Adjusted balance checks:** Confirm that every `i`-th listed token type in `_ids` has a sufficient balance in `__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from])` before executing deductions unless it results in a self-transfer.

These conditions rectify the balance verification logic and adhere to standard behaviors of ERC-1155 token transactions.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:27:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To address the verification error in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, we need to ensure the preconditions are met before any token state changes occur. Specifically, we must check that the sender's balance is sufficient before the transfer, and the `_from` address must have granted approval or be the caller of the function.

```

**Changes Made:**

- **Balance and Length Checks:** For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, added strong balance conditions both before and after the transfer. Ensures that each `_ids` entry above `_values` threshold works conditionally and doesn't invalidate rules for negative balance transitions.
- **Array Length Consistency:** Check to ensure length consistency between `_ids` and `_values`.
- **Transfer Validity and Non-Zero Address Check:** Ensure that all results conform to the ERC-1155 standard obligations concerning contract safety calls and event emissions. 

These modifications refine the logic across transfer functions and ensure proper validation for batch operations and address transitions consistent with the ERC-1155 standard.

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Key Corrections:**

- **Authorization:** Added postcondition to validate that the caller is authorized (either `_from == msg.sender` or has approval).
- **Balance Checks:** Ensures that for each token type in `_ids`, the balance for `_from` is checked against its corresponding value from `_values`, conforming with standard logic for batch transfers.
- **Array Length Validity:** Validates that `_ids` and `_values` arrays have the same length, as required by the standard.
- **State Transitions Consistency:** Ensures from-to balance transfer consistency across all indices.

These changes should resolve the verification issues while ensuring compliance with expected behavior per the ERC-1155 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'

### Key Elements:

- **Consistency Across Functions:** Ensure the balance verification and adjustments at each function account for state transitions as intended by the ERC-1155 specs with the same conditions as single transfers adjusted for batch context.
  
- **Authorization and Array Conditions:** Check proper approvals (`_from == msg.sender` or approved operator) and match between `_ids` and `_values` lengths for batch processes.

These adjustments should produce accurate reflection of the contract functions' intended behaviors in compliance with the ERC-1155 standard while satisfying the formal verification tool requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:29:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

```

#### Key Changes:

- **Authorization Check:** Ensures the caller is authorized to make the transfer by verifying approval or if the caller is the token holder.
  
- **Balance and Lenght Consistency:** Emphasized checks on lengths of `_ids` and `_values` and checked sufficient balances before deductions for all batch operation entries.
  
- **Self-Transfer Exemption:** Special handling for self-transfers, allowing them to bypass balance adjustments since the balance state does not change.

These adjustments should resolve verification issues, ensuring that all conditions align with the behavior expected from an ERC-1155 compliant contract.

### Key Elements:

- **Authorization:** Ensures that the caller is authorized either through direct ownership or has requisite approval (`_from == msg.sender` or approved operator).

- **Balance Checks:** Validates that `_from` has sufficient balance for each token type specified in `_ids` corresponding to the amounts specified in `_values`.

- **Self-Transfer Handling:** Non-applicable to batch operation as the balance verification accounts properly for required deductions and accumulation during inter-address transfers.

- **Length Consistency:** Ensures that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` arrays are equivalent, critical for ensuring every identifier has a corresponding value to operate on.

By accurately aligning the contract's behavior with these formal postconditions, we enhance assurance that the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function faithfully implements all necessary conditions according to the ERC-1155 swap standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:30:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Authorization Checks**: Ensure the caller is authorized by verifying that they are either the token holder or have been approved as an operator.

2. **Balance Checks**: Ensure that the balance from which tokens are being transferred is sufficient for each token type in the batch (`_ids`).

3. **Consistency Between Lengths of Arrays**: Verify that `_ids` and `_values` arrays have the same length, which is essential for reliable batch processing.

4. **Self-Transfer Handling**: The checks accurately handle cases where `_from` equals `_to`.

By ensuring these postconditions, you align the function's behavior with ERC-1155 specifications while meeting the formal verification tool's requirements. The corrected conditions help maintain state consistency ensuring successful transfers and proper handling of all edge cases.

=== USER [2025-04-17 04:30:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 04:30:55] ===
To address the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions of `safeBatchTransferFrom` correctly reflect the behavior as per the ERC-1155 standard, we need to guarantee sufficient balances and proper handling of transfers. Here’s how the contract should be annotated:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
    string private _uri;

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Authorization Check**: Ensure only authorized parties can execute a transfer, either as the holder or an approved operator.

2. **Balance Sufficient**: Ensure each transfer in a batch is only executed if the sender has sufficient balance for each `_id`.

3. **Array Length Validation**: Ensure the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match to guarantee each ID corresponds with a value.

4. **Correct Balance Adjustments**: Accurately account for and reflect the balance adjustments for both the sender and receiver after each transfer in the batch.

These adjustments ensure that the postconditions comprehensively validate the correct operation of the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function according to ERC-1155 specifications, with internal state changes accurately tracked.
