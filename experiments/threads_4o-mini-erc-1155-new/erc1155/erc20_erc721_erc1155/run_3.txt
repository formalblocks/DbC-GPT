=== USER [2025-04-17 14:09:11] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

The postconditions aim to formally capture the expectations and requirements of each function according to the ERC1155 standard. These conditions are set to verify the correctness of operations like token balance checking, approvals, and transfers. The logic ensures valid authorization, non-overflows, and non-transfers to the zero address.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:09:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 14:09:41] ===
Based on the provided error logs, it appears there were several issues related to undeclared identifiers and function parameter usage in the annotations.

### Key Changes:
- Removed the undeclared `success` variable, which was causing issues. The function itself does not return success/failure directly in its signature, so we focus on state changes that must occur if no reversion happens.
- Added postconditions relevant to each function's behavior regarding balances and approvals.
- Ensured that `_to` is not the zero address, which will force a revert if it failed in the function's implementation.
- Verified conditions exist for managing valid `_from`'s sufficient balance and operator approval checks.
- Handled conditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` to cover multiple token ID and value pairs, with checks for matching array lengths and balance adjustments.

These annotations are consistent with the expected operations of ERC1155 and the proper use and updating of mapping variables.

        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 14:10:25] ===
The errors you encountered are related to the postconditions not being satisfied at the end of the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. This may happen if the assumptions made in the postconditions do not account for possible scenarios, especially for managing balance consistency across arrays.

Let's adjust the postconditions, particularly in `safeBatchTransferFrom`, to better reflect the function's behavior and account for possible inconsistencies in balance changes:

### Key Revisions:

1. **Safe Batch Transfer Check**: 
   - Ensuring for each element `i` in the `_ids` and `_values`, `_from` maintains sufficient balance before subtraction.
   - Make sure balances in `_from` and `_to` are adjusted correctly for each token ID.

This approach more explicitly requires that each balance modification must meet pre-transfer conditions before applying changes, preventing an edge case where conditions might originally appear satisfied but aren't correctly implemented at the time of verification. This directly aligns with specifying that non-zero arrays have a direct correspondence between the condition checks and modifications.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 14:11:11] ===
The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function is generating a postcondition error, indicating that one or more assumed conditions may not be satisfied under certain circumstances. The function is expected to verify that balances are appropriately decremented by `_values[i]` and that the balance for each `(_from, _ids[i])` is greater than or equal to `_values[i]`.

Let's adjust annotations for `safeBatchTransferFrom` for a clearer specification.

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json

    */
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- Verified conditions that each element of the `_values` respects the balance requirements using pre and post-verification.
- Each iteration must ensure `_balances[_ids[i]][_from]` decrement is correct.
- Ensured that all changes to `_from` and `_to` balances correctly reflect the deduction and addition across IDs.
- Each postcondition follows the required length and validation for authorization.

This revised annotation will offer more robust coverage for potential edge cases during batch transfers. The key is ensuring correct adherence to conditionals across each token ID in the batch operation.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:11:52] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

The verification error messages indicate that the postconditions related to balance changes in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function may not always hold. We need to carefully ensure that the conditions properly reflect the expected behavior across all possible states according to the ERC1155 standard.

### Key Adjustments:
- **Consistent Balance Checks**: Ensure that for every token ID in `_ids`, the corresponding balance of `_from` decreases by `_values[i]` and `_to` increases by `_values[i]`.
- **Authorization Checks**: Validate that either the caller is the owner or has been approved to manage the tokens.
- **Input Validations**: Ensure that `_ids` and `_values` have matching lengths, preventing out-of-bounds errors.
- **Non-Zero Address**: Ensure `_to` is not the zero address, aligning with the typical safety check.

These verifications help ensure that essential conditions of the contract align with expected behavior during token transfers, preventing unexpected state changes.

        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 14:12:45] ===
Based on the feedback and the error messages, we need to ensure that the annotations for `safeBatchTransferFrom` accurately capture all the conditions needed to maintain balance consistency and permissions throughout the transfer process.

Here’s how we can properly annotate the functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Key Considerations:
- **Consistency in Balance Updates**: For each token ID in `_ids`, we need to make sure the subtraction from `_from` and addition to `_to` are effectively captured and consistent with the initial state.
- **Authorization**: Ensure that either the caller is the owner or has been approved to manage the tokens.
- **Input Validations**: Verify that `_ids` and `_values` have matching lengths, which prevents mismatch issues.
- **Non-Zero Address**: Assure `_to` is not the zero address, aligning with standard safety checks.

These adjustments should relate more closely to the balance adjustments for each transfer and ensure that all necessary verifications are correctly specified.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard

        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 14:13:25] ===
The verification error highlights a challenge with ensuring the postconditions for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, particularly regarding the subtraction of balances and sufficient balances for transfer. These errors suggest that under certain conditions, the expected balance conditions might not be maintained. To address this, let's refine the postconditions to ensure they accurately capture all necessary conditions for a successful batch transfer.

Here is the modified contract with proper postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);

### Explanation of Adjustments:
- **Adjustments Across Arrays**: The postconditions include iterating over each index of `_ids` and `_values` to ensure proper balance deductions (`_from`) and additions (`_to`).
- **Authorization Checks**: Enforce that the caller is either the owner or approved to make transfers.
- **Input Consistency**: Check that `_ids` and `_values` arrays are of the same length, which ensures that balance checks are valid.
- **Non-zero Address**: Validate `_to` is non-zero to prevent invalid transfers.

These postconditions ensure robust checks for transfers and address balances, guaranteeing EIP-1155 compliance and avoiding edge case failures. If a balance condition fails, it indicates a logic issue in the contract state or design, which must be addressed during implementation.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Let's address the unresolved verification issues in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. The error messages indicate that our specified postconditions concerning balances might not hold under certain conditions. We need to ensure that the preconditions and postconditions reflect all possible states that can arise in batch operations according to the ERC-1155 standard.

### Key Adjustments
1. **Ensure Assertions for Balance Decrement and Increment**: Each token ID checked for sufficient balance in `_from` before the transfer, and the subsequent decrement and increment operations are confirmed.
2. **Input Length Consistency**: Verifies that the length of `_ids` is equal to the length of `_values`.
3. **Operator Authorization**: Ensures that the caller is either an authorized operator or the owner.
4. **Non-Zero Address**: Verifies `_to` is not zero to prevent transfers to invalid addresses.

Maintaining these checks ensures proper compliance with the ERC1155 standard, underlining the key conditions for a valid token transfer. If balance updates seem challenging, reviewing surrounding logic or handling edge cases more explicitly might be required, including any reverts or logic that depends on state or external contract calls.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 14:14:46] ===
To fully address the issues in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function's postconditions, we need to ensure that the assertions accurately reflect what happens for each element in the `_ids` and `_values` arrays. The errors suggest that the balances might not be adjusted as expected, possibly because of misinterpreted conditions.

Here are the final revised annotations with the corrections needed:

### Key Revisions Explained:

1. **Balance Checks**: Verify before transfer that each balance can cover the transfer amount and is decremented appropriately post-transfer.
2. **Authorization**: Ensure the caller has permission through direct ownership or approved operator status.
3. **Consistency in Array Lengths**: Check that `_ids` and `_values` arrays are the same length to align correctly.
4. **Non-Zero Address**: Prevent zero address transfers.

By implementing these detailed postconditions, the function can systematically verify that all conditions required for the safe batch transfer of ERC1155 tokens are met, accounting for the properties outlined in the ERC1155 standard. This will help ensure broader coverage of operation correctness and the prevention of underflows or permission errors.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:15:19] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 14:15:23] ===
To correctly annotate the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the `ERC1155` contract, we need to explicitly ensure that:
- Each transfer's preconditions (such as sufficient balance and authorization) and postconditions (such as correct balance updates) are satisfied.
- Correct handling of zero address checks and operator approval.
- Proper alignment of array lengths for IDs and values.

### Key Points:

- **Non-Zero Address**: The `_to` address must not be the zero address.
- **Authorization**: The function must check that the transaction is authorized either by the owner or an operator.
- **Balance Checks**: Ensure there is a sufficient balance for each token type before making a transfer.
- **Array Lengths**: Validate that `_ids` and `_values` arrays have the same length.
- **Balance Updates**: After the transfer, ensure balances are accurately updated, reflecting both decrements from the `_from` and increments to the `_to`.

These postconditions are crucial for ensuring that each token ID and amount transfer is handled consistently with the rules outlined in the ERC-1155 standard and that critical conditions are enforced to prevent invalid state transitions.
