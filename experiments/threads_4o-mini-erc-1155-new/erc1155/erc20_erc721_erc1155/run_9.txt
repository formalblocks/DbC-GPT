    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:38:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

1. **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch:**
   - These functions are view functions, and their postconditions directly relate the return value `balance` or `batchBalances` to the state variable `_balances`.

2. **setApprovalForAll:**
   - This function's postcondition ensures that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping reflects the intended approval status after execution.

3. **isApprovedForAll:**
   - This function checks the approval status and returns the variable `approved` that should reflect the mapping's state.

4. **safeTransferFrom:**
   - The postconditions ensure that:
     - `_to` is not a zero address.
     - The sender (`msg.sender`) is approved to facilitate the transfer.
     - The balances before and after must reflect the decrease/increase in the `_from` and `_to` accounts, respectively.
     - Self-transfers (`_from == _to`) should ensure balances remain unchanged.

5. **safeBatchTransferFrom:**
   - It verifies that lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal.
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, it verifies balances for each token type in a batch manner while ensuring pre- and post-condition integrity consistent with the function's constraints.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:38:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **balanceOf:** The postcondition directly relates the return value to the state variable `_balances`, ensuring that the returned `balance` matches the stored value.

2. **balanceOfBatch:** This involves ensuring that the returned array `batchBalances` matches the corresponding balances in `_balances` for each owner/id pair; the lengths of the input and output arrays must match.

3. **setApprovalForAll:** The postcondition ensures the mapping `_operatorApprovals` reflects the intended approval state after execution (setting or revoking operator approval).

4. **isApprovedForAll:** The postcondition directly relates the return value `approved` to the operator approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **safeTransferFrom:** The postconditions verify:
   - `_to` is not a zero address.
   - The caller (or approved entity) is authorized.
   - The previous balance of `_from` is adequate for the transaction.
   - The balance updates for both `_from` and `_to` accounts are correctly handled, taking into account both transfers to different addresses and self-transfers (where no value movement occurs).

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom:** Similar checks as above, extended to multiple token types and amounts:
   - Ensuring the lengths of the `_ids` and `_values` arrays match.
   - Authorization as well as balance sufficiency are checked for each token type.
   - Balance updates validate transfer logic, including appropriate handling of self-transfers.

The adjustment of postconditions ensures the contract behaves as expected per ERC1155 guidelines, with special care for conditions of failure (like insufficient balances), accurate state updates, and correct authorization checks.

### Key Points of Annotations

1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:** 
   - The return values `balance` or `batchBalances` are directly related to the state's `_balances` mapping, ensuring correct results based on the stored balances.

2. **`setApprovalForAll`:** 
   - Sets the approval status for an operator, updated in `_operatorApprovals`. The postcondition verifies the mapping's state post-execution.

3. **`isApprovedForAll`:** 
   - Straightforward view function where return value `approved` reflects the stored approval state in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **`safeTransferFrom`:** 
   - Ensures `_to` is valid and the caller is approved.
   - Validates balance sufficiency.
   - Verifies balance updates with respect to `_from` and `_to`, being mindful of self-transfers.

5. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:** 
   - Ensures `_ids` and `_values` arrays have the same length.
   - Proper checks for balances for each transaction in the batch.
   - Correctly updates balances for both `_from` and `_to`, with regard for potential zero-value and self-transfers.

These postconditions ensure the correctness and safety of state transformations and data integrity as per the ERC1155 standard, addressing compliance within expected constraints and access levels.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:39:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Postcondition Details

1. **balanceOf:**
   - Returns the current balance from `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch:**
   - Ensures that each index in the resulting `batchBalances` array corresponds accurately to its respective owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll:**
   - Ensures that the operator approval setting reflects the `_approved` parameter post-execution.

4. **isApprovedForAll:**
   - Directly relates the operator's current approval status to the output.

5. **safeTransferFrom:**
   - Ensures the transfer is valid regarding non-zero addresses, appropriate balance reductions/additions, and necessary approvals.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom:**
   - Confirms array lengths match and handles each token transfer correctly with checks on balance sufficiency, approved access, and ensuring the internal state reflects these transactions accurately.

By covering these conditions, the contract formally respects the ERC1155 standard, including state manipulation constraints and required access controls for token management and balance verification.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points

1. **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch:** 
    - These view functions have postconditions that relate return values directly to `_balances` state variables.

2. **setApprovalForAll:** 
    - Sets the operator approval status in `_operatorApprovals` mapping, confirmed by postconditions.

3. **isApprovedForAll:** 
    - Directly checks the approval status, mapping return value `approved` to the stored state.

4. **safeTransferFrom and safeBatchTransferFrom:**
    - These functions involve moving tokens from one account to another.
    - Postconditions ensure authorization, adequacy of balances, and accurate state changes in `_balances`.
    - For self-transfers, no balance update occurs, and both success and failure are considered ("`success`" keyword cleaned).

By implementing these checks, the functions comply with the ERC1155 standard requirements. The formal verification conditions establish strong expectations of function behavior and safeguard the integrity of operations.

### Explanation of Annotations:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Directly relates the return value to the stored balance of a specific token ID for the provided owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures consistency in lengths between batch balances and input arrays.
   - Ensures each balance in the return array corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping based on input parameters.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Directly retrieves approval status from `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Conditions to avoid zero address transfers.
   - Checks proper authorization and pre-conditions for sufficient token balances.
   - Handles token balances change accurately for transfers, expecting the function may be a self-transfer (special handling condition).

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Confirms array length equality between `_ids` and `_values`.
   - Checks authorization and sufficient balances, iteratively for each element.
   - Ensures that transfers, including self-transfers, correctly update balances.

By implementing these postconditions, the contract functions are expected to reflect their intended purpose, maintaining consistency and robustness as stipulated by the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:42:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Postcondition Details:

1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:**
   - Both functions ensure the return values are directly tied to the `_balances` mapping.

2. **`setApprovalForAll`:**
   - Reflects changes in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping according to the `_approved` parameter, ensuring the operator approval status is correctly updated.

3. **`isApprovedForAll`:**
   - Directly returns the approval status sourced from `_operatorApprovals`, confirming if a particular operator is approved for the owner.

4. **`safeTransferFrom`:**
   - Ensures that transfers observe address validity (`_to` is not zero).
   - Verifies the sender is authorized (either the token holder or an approved operator).
   - Checks the sender's balance is sufficient for the transfer.
   - Manages balance reductions and increments while considering self-transfers.

5. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - Requires that the length of `_ids` matches `_values`.
   - Permits only valid non-zero target addresses.
   - Validates withdrawal authorization and ensures sufficient balances.
   - Adjusts balances accordingly, operates iteratively over token IDs, and respects self-transfers.

By adhering to these postconditions, the contract behaves as intended per ERC1155 specifications, guaranteeing robust checks and accurate state transformations within its operations.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:44:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Annotations:

1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:**
   - Relate the return values to the corresponding states stored in `_balances`.

2. **`setApprovalForAll`:**
   - Updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping following the input parameters.

3. **`isApprovedForAll`:**
   - Checks and returns the approval status directly from `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **`safeTransferFrom`:**
   - Ensures valid address input and confirms the caller is either the holder or an approved operator.
   - Verifies balance sufficiency, accounting for potential self-transfers where balances remain unchanged.

5. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - Confirms that `_ids` and `_values` arrays are of equal length.
   - Secures authorization, checks balance sufficiency for each token-transfer pair, and manages balances accurately in cases of transfer and self-transfer. 

By implementing these conditions, the contract effectively ensures appropriate behavior consistent with ERC1155 standards, while verifying correctness in token transfer operations and approvals. The conditions support robust contract functionality and integrity by ensuring that all possible paths in the contract logic maintain state consistency.

To correctly annotate the smart contract interface with formal verification conditions using the solc-verify syntax, we need to ensure that each function's postconditions reflect the expected behaviors as specified by the ERC1155 standard. Below is the annotated contract interface:

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

### Explanation of Annotations:

1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`:**
   - Postconditions reflect balances directly from the `_balances` state.

2. **`setApprovalForAll`:**
   - Postcondition verifies that `_operatorApprovals` is updated according to the `_approved` input.

3. **`isApprovedForAll`:**
   - Validates that the return value reflects the current approval status from `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **`safeTransferFrom`:**
   - Check that `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensure the sender is either the token holder or an approved operator.
   - Reflect correct balance deductions and additions, ensuring the function accounts for self-transfers where necessary.

5. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - Assure array length consistency between `_ids` and `_values`.
   - Similar checks are applied to each transfer regarding adequate balance and authorization, ensuring proper balance updates.
   - Handle self-transfers by confirming balances remain unchanged.

By inserting these postconditions, we ensure the functionality aligns with ERC1155's expected behaviors, covering use cases such as transfer authorization, balance management, and securing state integrity across operations.
