=== USER [2025-04-17 14:23:16] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: The postcondition specifies that the returned balance should match the balance stored in `_balances` for a given `owner` and `id`.

- **balanceOfBatch**: The postconditions ensure the length of `batchBalances` matches both `_owners` and `_ids`. It also asserts that each entry in `batchBalances` corresponds to the stored balance for every pair of owner and id.

- **setApprovalForAll**: It sets the approval status for a given operator on behalf of `msg.sender`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: The postcondition specifies that the returned approval status should match `_operatorApprovals` for the given owner/operator pair.

- **safeTransferFrom**: 
  * The postcondition ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
  * Asserts that the caller is approved to transfer the tokens (`_operatorApprovals` condition).
  * Checks the sender's balance is sufficient to cover the transfer.
  * Updates balances to reflect the transfer correctly.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  * Similar checks as `safeTransferFrom` but for multiple token IDs and values.
  * Ensures the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
  * Continuously asserts sufficient balances for each token type before transfer and updates balances accordingly. 

These annotations should align with the ERC1155 standard and help ensure the correctness of state changes made by the functions.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 14:23:52] ===
Let's address the issue with the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function's postcondition and provide proper annotations for each function. The error suggests that the postcondition which checks if the balance for each token ID in `_ids` is sufficient before deduction may not hold. We need to ensure that this postcondition is stated in a way that takes into account all possible execution paths, including the verification for balances. Here is the complete and corrected annotation for this contract:

### Key Adjustments
- **safeTransferFrom**: Fixed handling for when `_from == _to` to ensure balances are unchanged in self-transfer cases.
- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Corrected conditions to ensure all indices are checked while ensuring consistency with the operation, addressing the verifier error by refining conditions for repeated indices and balances.

This should address any issues with the formal verification passing. If there are further verification issues, they may need further postcondition refinements based on the specific function and operation logic.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-17 14:24:27] ===
To address the verification issues in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, we need to refine the postconditions to ensure they correctly capture the required balance changes and conditions for batch transfers. Let's provide the appropriate postcondition annotations for each function, with a particular focus on fixing the issues with `safeBatchTransferFrom`. Here is the revised contract with proper annotations:

```solidity

    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

### Explanation

- **balanceOf**: Relates the return value `balance` directly to `_balances`.
  
- **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures returned array matches `_owners` and `_ids` in length and content.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Postcondition states the required change in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Same principle, matching `approved` to the stored value.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Captures the input checks (nonzero `_to`, correct approval), balance sufficiency, and updates. Ensures balances adjust only if `_from` is not equal to `_to`.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Fixed postconditions to align with ensuring balance coverage for all IDs and values. Critical checks cover array consistency (`_ids.length == _values.length`), and specific asserts involve ensuring each pair's balance checks and subsequent deductions fulfill the requirements. Adjustments account for transfer semantics and contract invocation safety calls, remedying previous emission and balance update inconsistencies.

By carefully specifying these conditions, the annotations should meet the ERC1155 standard requirements. However, if still encountering verification errors, a further detailed analysis of call order or external interactions might be necessary.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:25:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the return value corresponds directly to the stored balance.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The checks ensure that each index in the batch balance array corresponds to the balance for a respective account and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms the effect on `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Matches output to stored approval state.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
    - Confirms `_to` is not address zero.
    - Validates approval.
    - Checks balance sufficiency for deduction.
    - If `_from` equals `_to`, leave balances unchanged, else ensure correct deduction/addition.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
    - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
    - Verifies length match between `_ids` and `_values`.
    - For each index, confirm sufficiency of balances before transactions, and assure correct deductions/additions for `_from` and `_to`.

These postconditions should now correctly verify the intended behavior of each ERC1155 function according to the specification. If issues persist, reexamining call sequences or interaction logic may be necessary for additional verification.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:

- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: Ensure that the returned values match the internal state of the balance mappings.

- **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Reflect changes or queries to operator approvals as specified by the standard.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**: Conditions included are necessary to handle balance updates and self-transfer scenarios.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Correct the balance checking mechanism within the preconditions, ensuring that balances hold as required before and after the transfer operation for each token type.
  - Ensure balances are managed correctly when `_from` is not equal to `_to`, ensuring no balance change if they are the same.

These annotations will help ensure that all batch transfer operations are correctly verified for pre-and post-state changes according to the ERC1155 rules, addressing any previous proof failures by incorporating conditions for all edge cases (e.g., zero transfers and self-transfers noted in the comments).

To annotate the ERC1155 contract with formal verification conditions, postconditions need to correctly capture the intended behavior of each function as specified by the ERC-1155 standard. It appears there's an issue with the `safeBatchTransferFrom` postcondition. Let's correct this along with providing appropriate annotations for the other functions.

```solidity

### Explanation
1. **`balanceOf` & `balanceOfBatch`**: These functions relate the outputs to the state variables, confirming that balances returned are accurate as per internal records.

2. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures the approval state for a given operator has been set to match `_approved`.

3. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms the function's return matches the internal approval mapping.

4. **`safeTransferFrom` & `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - **Checks**: Ensure `_to` is not zero, approvals are valid, and balances are sufficient.
   - **Effects**: Reflect changes in balances properly for `_from` and `_to`, with separate conditions to handle self-transfers (which result in no net change).

By aligning the postconditions to cover all semantic behaviors and state transitions expected in the ERC-1155 specification, these annotations help verify the contract's correctness regarding token movement and operator management. Adjusting conditions for multi-index handling in `safeBatchTransferFrom` aims to fix realistic usage contexts where balance availability needs accounting.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:27:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points

1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: The postconditions ensure that each return directly relates to the on-chain balances.

2. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures the `_operatorApprovals` mapping reflects the requested approval state change.

3. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Reflects directly fetching the approval state from `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
    - Checks that the recipient address is valid.
    - Verifies that the caller is approved to make the transfer or is the token holder.
    - Manages token balances when the sender is not the recipient, adjusting for transfer amounts as expected.

5. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
    - Checks key conditions, including that `_to` is not zero and the arrays are of identical length.
    - Ensures sufficient balances before deductions per entry and updates balance changes per ID only when `_from != _to` to handle self-transfers appropriately.
    - These annotations should ensure that any inconsistencies with conditions across batch transfers are accounted for and reflect the requirements of the ERC-1155 standard.

These conditions adequately reflect actions and the expected state of the contract according to the ERC-1155 standards, including proper management in self-transfer cases and array alignment for batch operations. This should help pass the verifier checks provided all other components are consistent and handled per the document’s context.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: These functions establish direct relations between their return values and the contract's current state variables.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: This checks that the approval state has been updated accurately post-execution.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: This confirms that the current stored approval state is returned consistently.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Conditions ensure `_to` is not the zero address, call is properly authorized, and sufficient token balance exists.
  - Balances are updated correctly when `_from` is different from `_to`, allowing the transfer to adjust balances appropriately.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensures each required check (recipient validity, approval, equal array lengths) is upheld.
  - Handles each token ID and respective value, confirming adequate balance for deduction exists prior to transaction.
  - Self-transfers should result in no net change, reflected in the conditional updates of balances.

These postconditions ensure each function complies with the ERC-1155 standards and facilitates accurate verification during the contract's formal verification process. This provides a robust framework for reliable multi-token management, aligned with both internal state transitions and external interface integrity.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.

    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard

### Explanation

1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: Relate the return values directly to the internal balances, ensuring results are based on the current state.

2. **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Reflect the state of `_operatorApprovals` post-transaction.

3. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures the `_to` address is not zero and checks for valid operator approvals.
   - Maintains conditions for balance sufficiency and updates balances accordingly, handling self-transfers (where `_from == _to`) properly.

4. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Validates `_to` is not zero, array lengths match, and each balance is sufficient before transfer.
   - Verifies that updates to balances occur correctly in line with ERC-1155 transfers, respecting array order.
   - Explicitly maintains conditions for each `id` in `_ids`, ensuring enough balance for each transfer while adjusting balances, and considers self-transfers without double-edits to balances.

This detailed annotation properly addresses the requirements, ensuring the functions handle transfers and approvals according to the ERC-1155 standard, and helps enforce contract integrity in verification tools.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:29:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points of the Annotations:

1. **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensure the return value accurately reflects the state of `_balances` for individual and multiple token IDs.

2. **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensure the state of approvals (_operatorApprovals) is accurately updated and queried.

3. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Verifies that the `_to` address is valid and approvals are correct.
   - Ensures sufficient balance is available for the transfer.
   - Correctly updates balances only if `_from` and `_to` are not the same (i.e., self-transfers).

4. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures validity of the `_to` address, correctness of approvals, and matching array lengths.
   - Confirms sufficient balance before performing each transfer in the batch.
   - Correctly reflects the balance changes when `_from` and `_to` are not the same and validates that transfers are performed in the correct order.

These postconditions are crucial in ensuring the contract behavior matches expectations for token balances and approvals, adhering closely to ERC1155 standards. This precise annotation allows formal verification tools to confirm the desired properties without facing logical conflicts in specific scenarios like self-transfers or insufficient balances.
