    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- In `balanceOf`, the postcondition specifies that the balance returned should match the stored balance for a given `_owner` and token `_id`.

- In `balanceOfBatch`, postconditions specify the length of `batchBalances` matches input arrays and each entry of `batchBalances` corresponds to the stored balances.

- In `setApprovalForAll`, the postcondition ensures that the approval mapping is updated correctly depending on `_approved`.

- `isApprovedForAll` ensures the result reflects the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- In `safeTransferFrom`:
  - The destination address `_to` should not be the zero address.
  - The caller must be approved, either directly or through an operator.
  - The postcondition ensures that after the transfer, the balance of `_from` will decrease and `_to` will increase by `_value`, except when `_from` equals `_to`.

- In `safeBatchTransferFrom`:
  - Similar checks ensure that inputs are consistent and balances adjust as specified for a batch of transfers.
  - Each token in `_ids` must have a corresponding value in `_values`.
  - The loop ensures for each transfer, the balance of `_from` decreases and the balance of `_to` increases as expected, if they are not the same address.

This approach ensures the system behaves according to the ERC1155 specifications and accurately reflects the intended changes and constraints on balances and approvals.

### Explanation:
- **View Functions (`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`):**
  - These functions directly return the state variable values based on input parameters.
  - The postconditions verify that the return values match the `_balances` mappings.

- **Approval Function (`setApprovalForAll`):**
  - The postcondition ensures the operator approval state reflects the `_approved` parameter.

- **Query Function (`isApprovedForAll`):**
  - The postcondition ensures that the returned `approved` status correctly matches the stored approvals for the given owner and operator.

- **Transfer Functions (`safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`):**
  - Conditions ensure `_to` is not the zero address and verify caller has approval.
  - The conditions handle balance changes, accounting for whether the transfer is a self-transfer, ensuring fair updates to both the sender’s and recipient’s balances.
  - The function also checks that balances are properly updated for batch transfers.

This is intended to safeguard and reflect the intended functionalities of the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:18:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Here is a corrected version of the ERC1155 contract with proper annotations following your guidelines. I have ensured that the postcondition for `safeBatchTransferFrom` corrects the issue by properly asserting the conditions on the balances before and after batch transfers.

```solidity

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Key Points:
- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the balance returned is directly from the `_balances` mapping.
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Asserts that each element in the returned `batchBalances` corresponds directly to the balance in `_balances` for the given pairs of `_owners` and `_ids`.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that after execution, the `_operatorApprovals` mapping reflects the new approval status.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Directly asserts the equivalence between the return value and the stored approval status.
- **`safeTransferFrom`**: Asserts non-zero destination address, approval checks, balance sufficiency, and balance updates consistent with the transaction rules.
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Ensures the above conditions for batch transfers, explicitly covering each transfer in the batch to verify proper balance decrement/increment and equality checks against zero-value transfers.

These conditions are specified according to the ERC-1155 standard requirements and solc-verify guidelines. They aim to ensure correctness, safety, and compliance with ERC-1155 behavior.

Let's properly annotate the ERC1155 smart contract interface with postconditions that accurately reflect its expected behavior based on the ERC1155 standard. I have revised the annotations to address the issues, particularly focusing on ensuring all balances in `safeBatchTransferFrom` are accurately verified.

### Key Adjustments:

- Ensured that all postconditions in `safeBatchTransferFrom` correctly check the existence and sufficiency of balances, particularly ensuring that the batch transfer condition for balances properly reduces `_from` balances and increases `_to` balances for each respective item.
- Special handling for self-transfers ensures that balances are preserved when `_from` is the same as `_to`.
- All `postcondition` statements are aligned with the original intent of the ERC-1155 standard while addressing the potential verification error on balance checks.
- Conditional logic is thoroughly articulated to verify behavior for each entry in `_ids` and `_values` arrays, maintaining integrity in balance accounting after operations.

These enhanced formal verification conditions help ensure the smart contract follows the mathematical model specified by the ERC-1155 standard, maintaining safety and correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:19:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Considerations:
- **View Functions**: Ensure the return values match exactly with the respective state mappings.
- **Approval Functions**: Reflect changes in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping based on the input parameters.
- **Transfer Functions**:
  - Ensure valid addresses (`_to` != address(0)) and sufficient balances before transfer.
  - Correctly handle balance decrements and increments ensuring consistency during address equivalence (self-transfers).
  - Ensure consistency between transfer amounts and balances.
- **Batch Transfers**: Each item's pre- and post-conditions in `safeBatchTransferFrom` are verified individually for correctness.

These conditions aim to provide a formal specification aligning with ERC-1155 standards using the solc-verify framework, making it robust to potential security and logic flaws.

        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:

- **View Functions**: 
  - `balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch` ensure returned balances are consistent with the `_balances` mapping.
  
- **Approval Functions**:
  - `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` ensure that the `_operatorApprovals` reflect the approval status accurately.

- **Transfer Functions**:
  - `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` ensure the `_to` address is valid and handle balances appropriately, including handling self-transfers where the balances do not change.

- **Batch Transfers**:
  - Ensures that balances for each token ID in a batch are checked and updated correctly.

These postconditions are designed to capture the expected behaviors as defined by the ERC1155 specification, ensuring correctness in a range of scenarios covering standard operations and edge cases such as self-transfers and safe transfers to contracts.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:21:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf and balanceOfBatch**:
  - Postconditions ensure balances returned match stored values in `_balances`.

- **setApprovalForAll and isApprovedForAll**:
  - Ensure that `_operatorApprovals` accurately reflects the approval status.

- **safeTransferFrom**:
  - Postconditions ensure the target address is valid, appropriate approvals are checked, and balances adjust appropriately—especially handling self-transfers where balances shouldn't change.

- **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
  - Properly verifies that for each token ID in the batch, the sufficient balance is available beforehand and adjusts the balances accordingly after transfers.
  - Ensures addresses are valid, lengths match, and the function behaves consistently with individual transfers.

These annotations are structured to ensure the contract behaves predictably and securely against common vulnerabilities and misuses, validating critical state transitions at each function operation as defined by the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-17 14:21:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Key Points:**

- **View Functions (`balanceOf`, `balanceOfBatch`)**: Ensure the return values reflect the expected balance data from the contract's state.
  
- **Approval Functions (`setApprovalForAll`, `isApprovedForAll`)**: Ensure that changes to approvals are accurately reflected within `_operatorApprovals`.

- **Transfer Functions (`safeTransferFrom`, `safeBatchTransferFrom`)**:
  - Verify valid receiver addresses to prevent sending tokens to a zero address.
  - Handle self-transfers by ensuring balances remain unchanged when `_from` equals `_to`.
  - Check sufficient balance availability before a transfer occurs.

- **Security Checks in `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
  - Match lengths of `_ids` and `_values` arrays.
  - Ensure that balance checks accommodate all items in the transaction to prevent execution errors.

These postconditions affirm the critical conditions in transactions mandated by the ERC1155 standard, focusing on security and data consistency.

        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Elements:

- **`balanceOf` and `balanceOfBatch`**: Postconditions directly relate the result to the `_balances` mapping, ensuring the functions correctly report balances.

- **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Postconditions reflect changes or retrievals in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping to ensure proper authorization management.

- **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures:
  - The recipient address is not a zero address.
  - `_operatorApprovals` or direct sender checks are performed.
  - The operation changes balances as expected, depending on whether it's a self-transfer.

- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Ensures:
  - Consistent array lengths for `_ids` and `_values`.
  - Adequate pre-condition checks for balances before transfer.
  - Balance adjustments occur as expected, accounting for both normal and self-transfers.

By consistently applying postconditions, you verify that each contract operation upholds the ERC1155 standard's expectations, preserving contract integrity and preventing unauthorized or erroneous state changes.
