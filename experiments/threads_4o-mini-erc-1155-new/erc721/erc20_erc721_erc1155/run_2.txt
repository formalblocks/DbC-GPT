    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Postcondition checks if the balance corresponds to the `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]` and the `_owner` should not be the zero address.
- **ownerOf**: Ensures the `_owner` is indeed the owner of `_tokenId`, and it isn't the zero address.
- **approve**: Verifies that `msg.sender` is the token owner or an approved operator and updates the approved address for `_tokenId`.
- **getApproved**: Checks if `_tokenId` is valid and returns the approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms operator approvals per owner are correctly set.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies if an operator is approved for the owner.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads): Ensures that the ownership changes are correctly reflected in `_tokenOwner` and `_ownedTokensCount`, and that the `msg.sender` is appropriately authorized.
- **safeTransferFrom** with data: Similar to `transferFrom` with an additional check for the ERC721Receiver interface compatibility.

These annotations ensure that the function behaviors comply with the ERC-721 standard's expected conditions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:06:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Verifies the balance returned is equal to the count of tokens owned by `_owner` and ensures that `_owner` is not the zero address.
- **ownerOf**: Confirms the returned owner is the owner of `_tokenId` and that the owner is valid (non-zero address).
- **approve**: Ensures that `msg.sender` is the current token owner, or has been approved by the owner, and accurately records the approved address for the specified token.
- **getApproved**: Postcondition to ensure it returns the current approved address for the token.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator approvals are set correctly for the calling user.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the return value matches the stored approval status for the operator.
- **transferFrom**: Confirms the token is transferred to the correct address, and the balances of the _from and _to accounts are updated accordingly. Ensures `msg.sender` is properly authorized to perform the transfer.
- **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, checks the correct updates to balances and owner, ensuring the recipient address is not zero.
- **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Same postconditions as the previous function with additional verification that `onERC721Received` is correctly called on the target contract.

These annotations aim to verify that the postconditions align with the intended behaviors specified in the ERC-721 standard, ensuring correct ownership transfers, approvals, and balance updates.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: The function returns the balance equal to `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]` if `_owner` is not the zero address.
- **ownerOf**: The function confirms that `_owner` is indeed the owner of `_tokenId`, and that this address is not zero.
- **approve**: Ensures the approved address for `_tokenId` is updated accordingly, making sure the caller is authorized.
- **getApproved**: It confirms that the returned approved address is accurate for the specified token.
- **setApprovalForAll**: This postcondition ensures that the operator approval reflects the new status.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Matches the correct authorization state from `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom**: Validates the ownership and balance changes, ensuring no transfer to the zero address and handling the self-transfer case.
- **safeTransferFrom**: Complements `transferFrom` with the same logic but does a safety check for ERC721 compatibility.
- **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Includes the function from above plus additional logic for receiver compatibility with ERC721. 

These annotations firmly align each function with its role as specified in the ERC-721 standard, supporting error handling, ownership validation, and operational consistencies.

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Confirms the `_owner` is not the zero address and that the balance matches the owned token count stored in `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf**: Verifies that the returned owner matches `_tokenOwner`, and that this owner is a valid address.
- **approve**: Ensures that only authorized parties can approve a new controller, and that the approval is correctly stored.
- **getApproved**: Ensures the correct approved address is returned as stored in `_tokenApprovals`.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the operator's approval status change is accurately recorded.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the approval status is consistent with the recorded state in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom**: Ensures transfer authorization, correct token ownership transfer, prevention of zero address as `_to`, and proper balance updates.
- **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, adds recipient safety checks with no additional data.
- **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same checks as above, with the inclusion of checks for smart contract receivers via `onERC721Received`.

These specifications aim to provide a reliable, formally verified implementation of the ERC-721 standard functionalities.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:07:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the function does not process for the zero address and confirms the balance returned matches the count stored in `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf**: Verifies that the address returned is the owner of `_tokenId` and not the zero address.
- **approve**: Ensures only the owner or an authorized operator can set the approved address and that it is stored correctly.
- **getApproved**: Confirms the function returns the approved address stored in `_tokenApprovals`.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the operator's approval status is updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures correctness by comparing the return value to the stored approval status.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Verify that transfers update the owner and balances correctly, do not allow the zero address as the recipient, handle self-transfer appropriately, and require proper authorization.
- **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Adds an additional check to ensure compatibility with ERC721Receiver contracts.

These annotations maintain conformity with the ERC-721 contract standards and aim to improve the robustness and security of the contract implementation through formal verification measures.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:08:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner is not the zero address and that the returned balance is equal to the stored `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf**: Confirms that the owner of `_tokenId` is returned and is not a zero address.
- **approve**: Assures that only the owner or a verified operator can approve a transfer, and the approval is stored in `_tokenApprovals`.
- **getApproved**: Checks that the correct approved address for `_tokenId` is returned.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the operator approval status is reflected in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Matches the expected operator approval status with the stored information.
- **transferFrom**: Ensures:
  - The NFT is transferred to the correct recipient `_to`, who is not the zero address.
  - Updates the balances of `_from` and `_to` properly based on ownership transfers.
  - Authenticates the sender’s authority to transfer the NFT.
- **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Includes checks similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring the safe transfer routing.
- **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Adds verifying conditions to ensure the transfer is safely received by contracts implementing `ERC721Receiver`.

These annotations are designed to capture the expected behaviors while following the ERC-721 standard requirements closely, focusing on balance updates and ownership changes metrics uniformly across the related functions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:08:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Checks that `_owner` is not zero and returns the stored count of tokens owned.
  
- **ownerOf**: Confirms the returned owner matches the stored owner in `_tokenOwner`, ensuring it's not zero.

- **approve**: Validates that the caller is either the owner of `_tokenId` or an approved operator before setting the approval in `_tokenApprovals`.

- **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address is the same as in `_tokenApprovals`, given that the token is valid.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Reflects the approval status change for operators in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Matches the actual stored approval value for a given owner and operator pair.

- **transferFrom**: Validates:
  - The transfer updates the `_tokenOwner` and `_ownedTokensCount` as expected.
  - The sender is authorized (owner, operator, or approved).
  - Ensures non-zero `_to` and handles self-transfer edge cases.

- **safeTransferFrom (no data)**: Ensures compliance with `transferFrom` plus a check for the non-zero `_to`.

- **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Adds logic to check if `_to` is a contract and ensures compatibility with the ERC721Receiver if so.

These annotations follow the ERC-721 specification for each function, ensuring consistent behavior and validation of ownership and approvals across related functions.

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned is consistent with the state variable `_ownedTokensCount` for a non-zero address.

- **ownerOf**: Validates that the address returned is indeed the owner of the `_tokenId`, ensuring it's not the zero address.

- **approve**: Confirms the correct update of the approved address in `_tokenApprovals` and ensures the caller is authorized (either owner or operator).

- **getApproved**: Validates that the correct approved address is returned.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures the modification of the approval status for a given operator is accurately reflected.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Assures the return matches the stored operator approval status.

- **transferFrom**: Ensures:
  - Ownership transfer updates: `_tokenOwner`, `_ownedTokensCount` are correct for valid sender authorizations.
  - Non-zero receiver address.
  - Adjust balance, specifically handling self-transfer cases.

- **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Same logic applies as `transferFrom`, confirming secure transfer without additional data handling.

- **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Handles the contract-specific retrieval and ensures compatibility with the ERC721Receiver interface, by checking code size as a proxy for contract detection.

These specifications are crafted to reliably enforce and verify behaviors as expected by the ERC-721 standard across all significant operations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:09:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

The error you're seeing indicates that you've attempted to declare state variables in an interface, which is not allowed. Interfaces in Solidity should only declare function signatures without any implementation details, internal logic, or state variables. Let's focus on creating the correct postconditions for each function in this `IERC721` interface without including any state variables within the interface itself. Here’s how you can do that:

```solidity

     * @dev NFTs assigned to the zero address are considered invalid, and this
     *  function throws for queries about the zero address.

     * @return The number of NFTs owned by `_owner`, possibly zero
     */
    /// @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _ownedTokensCount[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

### Explanation:
- **Interface**: Interfaces in Solidity should only contain function signatures, not state variables.
- **Postconditions**: Each function is annotated with postconditions to ensure the fundamental properties of count, ownership, approvals, and transfer mechanics are verified:
  - `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` ensure correct balances and ownership.
  - `approve`, `getApproved`, and `setApprovalForAll` handle authorization of third-party operators.
  - `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` focus on ensuring correct transfer mechanics, handling cases like zero addresses and updating token ownership.
- **Verification**: These specifications use solc-verify annotations to declare postconditions that should hold true upon function execution, supporting robust and correct implementation according to the ERC-721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:10:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:10:10] ===
Let's refine and correct the postconditions for the `IERC721` smart contract interface functions, ensuring proper use of solc-verify annotations while respecting the ERC-721 standards and the specified requirements.

In particular, we'll ensure postconditions reflect expected behavior, handle self-transfers correctly, use only declared state variables (albeit declared in the actual ERC721 implementation, not the interface here), and maintain consistency with uncleared identifiers or conditions.

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the address is not zero and that the balance reflects the `_ownedTokensCount` state.
  
- **ownerOf**: Confirms the returned owner matches what is stored and checks for non-zero owner conditions.
  
- **approve**: Required checks for correct update of the approved address involving authorized users (owner or specified operators).
  
- **getApproved**: Ensures the approval status aligns with what's recorded in `_tokenApprovals`.
  
- **setApprovalForAll**: Verifies the approval status for the operator reflects the change made by the caller.
  
- **isApprovedForAll**: Consistency guaranteed with the stored operator approval status.
  
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Operate on correct ownership state transitions, non-zero recipient, and authorized actions. Handles post-transfer conditions and checks for contracts when dealing with safe transfers.

These annotations are intended for robust verification (matching ERC-721 standards) using the solc-verify syntax in a smart contract context that does maintain state variables.
