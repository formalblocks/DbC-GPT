=== USER [2025-04-16 17:12:25] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf**:
   - It ensures that the returned value for `_owner` matches the internal `_ownedTokensCount`.
   - Checks if `_owner` is not the zero address as tokens cannot be owned by the zero address.

2. **ownerOf**:
   - Indicates the owner of a given `_tokenId` and ensures that owner exists (non-zero address).

3. **approve**:
   - Establishes that `_approved` is stored for `_tokenId` and only if `msg.sender` is the owner or an approved operator.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Confirms that the returned value matches the approval address for the `_tokenId` if it exists.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that `_operator` is approved or revoked by `_msg.sender` across all assets.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Checks whether `_operator` is approved for all of `_owner`'s assets.

7. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**:
   - These conditions manage the token ownership transfer and decrease the sender's and increases the recipient's token count, respectively. They also ensure ownership changes appropriately. The functions should also check the correct return signature when `_to` is a contract in case of the `safeTransferFrom` variant.

This approach aligns with the ERC721 requirements and ensures consistency, helping to verify that the contract adheres to the expected postconditions for key operations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:13:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf:** 
  - Checks if the balance matches with `_ownedTokensCount`.
  - Ensures `_owner` is not the zero address, as querying for zero address is not valid.

- **ownerOf:** 
  - Confirms the ownership of a `_tokenId`.
  - Also ensures the owner address is not zero.

- **approve:** 
  - Sets and verifies that `_approved` address is registered for `_tokenId`.
  - Validates that `msg.sender` can approve (it must be the token owner or an approved operator).

- **getApproved:** 
  - Ensures the returned 'approved' address is accurate for `_tokenId`.

- **setApprovalForAll:** 
  - Adjusts `_operatorApprovals` mapping accordingly to `_approved`.

- **isApprovedForAll:** 
  - Confirms if `_operator` is an approved operator for `_owner`.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom (both overloads):** 
  - Checks:
    - Ownership transfer: Updates token ownership and adjusts counts.
    - Success & Failure: Considers both scenarios to maintain consistency.
    - Ensures proper decrement and increment of ownership counts unless a self-transfer. 

These postconditions help ensure compliance with the expected behavior while allowing verification of the smart contract requirements according to the ERC-721 specification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:13:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:13:59] ===
When working with Solidity annotations for formal verification, it’s important to ensure that the implementation aligns with ERC standards and accurately tracks state changes. Below, I've structured the `IERC721` contract with annotations for postconditions, resolving errors by ensuring identifiers are correctly specified within the constraints of annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /// @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition _owner == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
    /// @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved
    /// @notice postcondition msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender]
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool approved);

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to || _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == __verifier_old_uint(_tokenOwner[_tokenId]) && !success
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1 || _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) && !success
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1 || _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) && !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to || _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == __verifier_old_uint(_tokenOwner[_tokenId]) && !success
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1 || _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) && !success
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1 || _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) && !success
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to || _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == __verifier_old_uint(_tokenOwner[_tokenId]) && !success
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1 || _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) && !success
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1 || _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) && !success
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Key Aspects:

1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The function ensures the owner isn't a zero address and returns the balance matching `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - Confirms the owner of `_tokenId` isn't the zero address.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensures approval is granted only if sent by the owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Checks that the approved address for `_tokenId` is valid.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Updates the `_operatorApprovals` for the calling account as expected.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Verifies if the operator is approved for all of the owner's assets.

7. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensure that proper changes in ownership and token counts occur or stay unchanged if not successful.

These annotations provide a structured approach to verify the intended contract behavior against the ERC-721 standard, ensuring correct state transitions and data integrity.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:14:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:14:25] ===
To properly annotate each function in the `IERC721` interface with formal verification postconditions, we need to ensure that they accurately reflect the ERC-721 standard functionality. Below are the functions with their respective postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /// @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _ownedTokensCount[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _owner == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved
    /// @notice postcondition msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender]
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /// @notice postcondition result == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool result);

    /// @notice postcondition (_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to) || (_from == _to && __verifier_old_uint(_tokenOwner[_tokenId]) == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1) || (_from == _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) == _ownedTokensCount[_from])
    /// @notice postcondition (_ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1) || (_from == _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) == _ownedTokensCount[_to])
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition (_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to) || (_from == _to && __verifier_old_uint(_tokenOwner[_tokenId]) == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1) || (_from == _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) == _ownedTokensCount[_from])
    /// @notice postcondition (_ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1) || (_from == _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) == _ownedTokensCount[_to])
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition (_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to) || (_from == _to && __verifier_old_uint(_tokenOwner[_tokenId]) == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1) || (_from == _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) == _ownedTokensCount[_from])
    /// @notice postcondition (_ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1) || (_from == _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) == _ownedTokensCount[_to])
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **balanceOf**: Validates the invariant that `_ownedTokensCount` reflects the actual balance of `_owner`.

- **ownerOf**: Confirms the NFT's owner against `_tokenOwner` mapping.

- **approve**: Ensures the newly set approved address for an NFT.

- **getApproved**: Retrieves and confirms the approved address for a given token ID.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets or revokes approval for all NFTs for `_operator` and ensures the update is reflected in the state.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms if an operator is allowed to manage all assets for a specific owner.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: 
  - Check that `_tokenId` is transferred to `_to` and balances are correctly updated.
  - Include the handling of transfers when `_from` is equal to `_to` (self-transfer logic).

These postconditions ensure that the contract functions behave correctly, as per the ERC-721 standard, maintaining consistency and integrity of the internal state.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:14:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf** and **ownerOf**: Correctly check if the owner is not the zero address and perform balance and ownership verification as per mappings.
  
- **approve**: Ensures that the approval only occurs when `msg.sender` is the owner or operator of the token.

- **getApproved**: Returns the approved address for the specified token ID, ensuring that the token ID corresponds to a valid owner.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Modifies the operator approval status for all of the caller's tokens.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Validates if an operator is authorized for an owner, with the accurate use of `result` removed as a misunderstanding.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Ensure ownership transition and adjustments in token ownership counts, including self-transfer handling when `_from` equals `_to`.

These annotations correctly reflect ERC-721 standard operations and validate state changes meaningfully, supporting both successful and self-transfer scenarios.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:15:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Each Function's Annotations
- **balanceOf**: 
  - Validates that the owner is not the zero address.
  - Ensures the balance returned matches the count of tokens owned as stored in `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**:
  - Confirms the owner of the NFT as per `_tokenOwner` mapping.
  - Checks that the owner is not the zero address.

- **approve**:
  - Sets the `_approved` address for the `_tokenId`.
  - Ensures that the caller can approve the token—either because they are the owner or an authorized operator.

- **getApproved**:
  - Retrieves the approved address for a `_tokenId` and ensures it reflects the current state of `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll**:
  - Updates `_operatorApprovals` to reflect whether a third party (`_operator`) is approved to manage all assets of `msg.sender`.

- **isApprovedForAll**:
  - Validates whether an operator is approved for the owner's assets, returning the correct boolean according to `_operatorApprovals`.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads):
  - In these functions, we adjust the ownership of tokens and balances:
  - Ensure that `_tokenOwner` for the `tokenId` is set to `_to`.
  - Decrease `_from`'s count if the token is transferred.
  - Increase `_to`'s token count under the assumption success is possible, while handling the special case for self-transfers where counts do not change.

This structure and annotations ensure these functions' behaviors align with the ERC-721 standard, track state changes coherently, provide consistency, and include cases like self-transfer.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:16:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points and Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance of NFTs returned for an owner matches the `_ownedTokensCount` mapping, and validates that the queried owner address is not zero.

- **ownerOf**: Checks that `_tokenId` returns the correct owner from the `_tokenOwner` mapping, asserting the owner is valid (not zero address).

- **approve**: Asserts an NFT's approval is correctly set by the actual owner or an authorized operator.

- **getApproved**: Validates the approved address for a particular `_tokenId`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates `_operatorApprovals` to reflect approval changes for all assets.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Checks whether an operator is authorized for an owner with the correct logical result variable.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads): 
  - Transfers token ownership and adjusts both `_from` and `_to` account balances.
  - Handles the special case where `_from` and `_to` are the same address, ensuring no changes to balances in this self-transfer case.

These annotations ensure that each function behavior aligns with the ERC-721 specification, maintaining correct state transitions and handling various transfer and approval conditions.

### Explanation
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the return value matches the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_owner`, with a guard against zero _owner address.
  
- **ownerOf**: Retrieves owner from `_tokenOwner` and validates it isn't a zero address, ensuring integrity of ownership.

- **approve**: Sets the approved address and ensures only the owner or an authorized operator can set approval.

- **getApproved**: Returns the current approved address for the token, asserting the token has a valid owner.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates `_operatorApprovals` mapping ensuring the operator's status reflects in subsequent calls.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies the approval condition for specific owner-operator pairs, returning the existing value in the mapping.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads): 
  - They handle ownership transfer and update balances with special consideration for self-transfers:
  - If `_from` and `_to` are not equal: updates the owners and counts correctly.
  - If `_from` equals `_to`: maintains the integrity of ownership and count balances.

These postconditions provide the necessary checks for implementing the ERC-721 standard, ensuring compliance with the expected state modifications for each function.

### Key Considerations:
- **balanceOf** and **ownerOf**: Validate that functions operate normally on non-zero addresses and accurately represent the counting and owning states.

- **approve**: Ensure the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator, who can establish the approved address mapping.

- **getApproved** and **setApprovalForAll**: Accurately check the approved mappings as per current contract state.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Correctly verify the operator approval mapping.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Handle both successful transfer and self-transfer scenarios, ensuring balances change as expected, depending on whether the source and destination are the same.

This structure complements the defined ERC-721 behavior by maintaining invariant conditions and appropriate state changes throughout the functions.
