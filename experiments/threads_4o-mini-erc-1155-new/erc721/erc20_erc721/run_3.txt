=== USER [2025-04-16 15:34:42] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

Key changes include:
- Proper use of `__result` to indicate the return value of the function in `isApprovedForAll`.
- Ensuring the `approve` function checks the appropriate sender permissions.
- Assurance that `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` correctly handle non-zero addresses.
- Postcondition that each transfer function resets approvals and updates the respective ownership mappings accurately.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:35:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf** ensures the return value equals the owner's token count and owner addresses must be non-zero.
- **ownerOf** guarantees the token owner's address is correct and is not zero.
- **approve** confirms the specified address is approved for the given token, subject to authorization checks.
- **getApproved** ensures the approved address for a token is returned unless the token does not exist.
- **setApprovalForAll** sets the operator approval status for the caller.
- **isApprovedForAll** returns whether an operator is approved for an owner.
- **Transfer Functions** (transferFrom, safeTransferFrom) manage ownership transfer, adjust balances, and clear the token approval if necessary, accommodating cases where the sender and recipient are the same.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:35:48] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Correct __result Usage**: Correctly used for `isApprovedForAll` to indicate the function's return value.
- **Self-transfers and Zero Addresses**: Special handling for scenarios where `_from` might equal `_to` or when zero addresses aren't valid is stated explicitly with conditions ensuring non-zero addresses precondition.
- **Integrity of Token Ownership**: Ensure that the owner changes are adequately reflected after transfers, and approvals are reset upon these transfers.

Here is the annotated smart contract interface including the necessary `solc-verify` postconditions for verification according to the ERC721 standard, taking into account the previous comments and errors regarding annotations:

```solidity

### Key Highlights:
- **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf`:** Ensure these view functions correctly relate returns to the appropriate state variables.
- **`approve` and `getApproved`:** Update and verify approval mappings reflecting these values.
- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Reflect the approval state for an operator on behalf of the caller.
- **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`:** Accurately update ownership, approval states, and address validations to ensure correct token handling, especially handling self-transfers by maintaining consistency in owned token counts.

### Key Points Addressed:
- **Handling Ownership and Approvals**: Ensures correct state for `_tokenOwner` and `_tokenApprovals`.
- **Self-transfer Handling**: Handles cases where `_from` and `_to` might be the same, ensuring owned token counts remain consistent.
- **Preconditions for Non-zero Addresses**: Explicitly checks that `_to` is a valid address to ensure consistent behavior.
- **State Changes After Transfers**: Nulls out the approval post-transfer and shifts ownership correctly, guaranteeing compliance with the ERC721 standard.

Below, I'll provide the annotations including detailed `solc-verify` postconditions for each function in the `IERC721` interface. The annotations are based on the typical behavior defined by the ERC721 standard.

```solidity

### Key Points:
- **View Functions**: Ensure postconditions relate the return values directly to state variables and check for zero-address errors.
- **Ownership and Approval Changes**: Consider the conditions where the operation is valid (e.g., the owner or operator is authorized) and verify state transitions accordingly.
- **Transfer Operations**: Ensure that ownership transfers, token approvals resets, and that self-transfers (`_from == _to`) maintain correct token counts.
- **Non-zero Address Precondition**: Ensure operations are only valid with non-zero addresses, reinforcing essential contract invariants.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:37:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
- **View Functions**: `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` link state to pre-existing mappings directly, ensuring valid outputs for non-zero `_owner`.
- **Approve Functions**: `approve` and `getApproved` methods align the `_approved` address with internal checks, guaranteeing proper authorization.
- **Operator Functions**: `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` guarantee operator permissions reflect caller's settings.
- **Transfer Functions**: Correct handling of ownership transfer, resetting of approvals, and modifying balances are ensured while preserving the invariants, especially during self-transfers (`_from == _to`).

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

### Key Considerations:
- **View Functions**: Ensure returns are directly tied to state variables, and null addresses are handled properly.
- **Approvals**: Ensure only authorized actions can change approval states.
- **Transfers**: Update mappings accurately for token ownership and count, reset approvals, and ensure the non-zero target address.
- **Self-transfers**: Specifically addressed to maintain precise accounting, although generally invalid in NFT logic, it still ensures no balance changes if `_from` and `_to` are the same address.

### Explanation:
- **View Functions**: `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` link the return values directly to the mappings and validate non-zero addresses.
- **Approval Management**: `approve` and `getApproved` adjust and check the `_tokenApprovals` mapping. The caller must be the owner of the token or authorized by them.
- **Operator Approvals**: `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` maintain and query `_operatorApprovals`.
- **Transfers**: Both `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` handle ownership transfer, nullify any existing token approvals, and modify token counts accurately, while avoiding errors when sender and receiver are identical.
