=== USER [2025-04-16 15:39:44] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To annotate the given ERC721 smart contract interface with proper formal verification conditions, we'll follow the guidelines provided and add the essential postconditions for each function. These postconditions will use the state variable names exactly as declared, relate return values directly to state variables for view functions, and ensure that all conditions are consistent with ERC721 standards.

Let's apply these guidelines:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the balance returned is equal to the count of tokens owned by the `_owner` and checks that the `_owner` is not the zero address.
- **`ownerOf`**: Ensures the returned `_owner` is the registered owner of the `_tokenId` and is not the zero address.
- **`approve`**: Ensures that the approval can only be updated by the current token owner or an authorized operator and updates the `_tokenApprovals`.
- **`getApproved`**: Ensures the returned approved address corresponds to the given `_tokenId`.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that operators for an owner are set correctly.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures the return value reflects the approval status of an operator for an owner.
- **`transferFrom`/`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensure that the caller is authorized to transfer the token, the ownership is updated, and the balance changes are consistent with token movement constraints.

This structured annotation ensures compliance with ERC721 and formal verification by relating blockchain state changes to function logic.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:40:19] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf`**: Checks that `_owner` is not the zero address and returns the correct balance from `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
- **`ownerOf`**: Asserts that `_owner` is correctly recorded for the `_tokenId` and is not a zero address.
- **`approve`**: Updates the approval status for a `_tokenId`, ensuring the caller is authorized.
- **`getApproved`**: Returns the address approved to handle `_tokenId`.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that the operator approval state matches the input.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Checks if an operator is authorized to manage all assets of `_owner`.
- **`transferFrom` / `safeTransferFrom`**: Checks that the transfer conditions and changes in ownership are properly validated according to ERC721 standards, considering the case of transferring an NFT to the same address (self-transfer handling).

These postconditions align the contract functions with the ERC721 standard and ensure coherent formal verification annotations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:40:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf`**: Asserts that `_owner` is not the zero address and the balance matches the entries in `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **`ownerOf`**: Confirms the owner returned by `_tokenOwner` is not the zero address and matches the token ID.
- **`approve`**: Assures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator, and sets the `_tokenApprovals`.
- **`getApproved`**: Confirms that `_tokenId` is valid and returns the appropriate approved address.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Sets the approval state of an operator for a user.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Returns the operator's approval status based on stored data.
- **`transferFrom`** and **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensure ownership transfer is valid, account balances are updated appropriately, and approvals are reset.

These conditions ensure that the functions execute as intended per the ERC721 standard, handling both successful and edge cases like self-transfers appropriately.

To annotate the given ERC721 smart contract interface with proper formal verification conditions, we'll follow the provided guidelines. Here's how the contract can be annotated with `solc-verify` postconditions, ensuring consistency with the ERC721 standard:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that `_owner` is not the zero address and returns the correct balance from `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
- **`ownerOf`**: Asserts that `_owner` is non-zero and properly corresponds to the stored owner of `_tokenId`.
- **`approve`**: Checks that the caller is appropriately authorized (as the owner or an operator) and updates the approval mapping.
- **`getApproved`**: Verifies that if the token is assigned, its approval status is correctly returned.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms the operator's approval status is set correctly for all owner's assets.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms it reports whether an operator manages all assets of a specific owner.
- **`transferFrom`** and **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensure consistency in transferring ownership changes, updates `_ownedTokensCount`, resets approvals to zero, and verifies that transfers are authorized per ERC721 standards.

These conditions provide a robust annotation of the interface, conforming to the ERC721 contract specifications and ensuring expected behavior through formal verification checks.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:41:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Considerations:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Validates that the balance corresponds directly to the `_ownedTokensCount`.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Verifies the owner of a token ID exists and returns the correct owner address.
3. **`approve`**: Ensures that the approval is correctly set, given the caller's authorization.
4. **`getApproved`**: Retrieves the approved address correctly if the token ID is valid.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Sets the operator approval status for all tokens of the caller.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms if an operator is authorized for the owner's assets.
7. **`transferFrom`**/**`safeTransferFrom`**: Covers transfer ownership validation, ownership updates, and resets token approvals, managing both direct and safe transfers while addressing self-transfer cases.

These annotations guide formal verification by illustrating and enforcing expected behaviors per the ERC721 standard.

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the number of tokens owned by `_owner`, and `_owner` cannot be a zero address.
- **`ownerOf`**: Ensures that the returned owner of `_tokenId` matches the internally stored owner, with a valid non-zero address.
- **`approve`**: Ensures that the `_approved` address is updated for `_tokenId`, provided the caller is authorized (owner or operator).
- **`getApproved`**: Returns the approved address for `_tokenId`, ensuring `_tokenId` is valid.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: The operator approval status for the caller is correctly set.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Correctly returns the approval status for a given operator by the owner.
- **`transferFrom`/`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures transfer conditions are satisfied (e.g., ownership, valid token ID, non-zero `_to`), updates ownership, manages self-transfers properly, and clears token approvals.

These annotations facilitate verification that contract operations adhere to the ERC721 standard, ensuring expected conduct in token handling and ownership management.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:41:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the balance corresponds directly to `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`, with `_owner` not being the zero address.
- **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that `_owner` of `_tokenId` aligns with `_tokenOwner` mapping and isn't the zero address.
- **`approve`**: Ensures `_approved` becomes the new or confirmed NFT controller when the sender has authorization.
- **`getApproved`**: Returns the approved address for `_tokenId` if it's valid, meaning `_tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)`.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Changes the approval state of `_operator` for the caller's total asset management.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms it represents whether `_operator` is authorized for `_owner`.
- **`transferFrom`/`safeTransferFrom`**: Manages NFT ownership transfer, handling balances and resetting approvals, while requiring proper authorization from the caller (current owner, authorized operator, or approved address). Also addresses self-transfer scenarios in balance updates. 

These annotations are designed to ensure consistency across function behaviors, respecting the ERC721 specifications, while allowing formal verification to capture and confirm these constraints.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:42:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensure the balance is directly derived from `_ownedTokensCount` and that `_owner` is a valid address.
- **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the owner of `_tokenId` is correctly retrieved and the owner is not the zero address.
- **`approve`**: Validates that only the owner or an approved operator can set an approval for an NFT, and sets `_approved` as the new approved address.
- **`getApproved`**: Retrieves the approved address for a given `_tokenId` if it is valid.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Adjusts the operator approval state, enabling or disabling the operator to manage all of the caller's assets.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Returns whether an operator is approved to manage all tokens of `_owner`.
- **`transferFrom`/`safeTransferFrom`**: Handles the transfer conditions: authorization, non-zero destination address, updates the owner, adjusts `_ownedTokensCount`, and clears the approval for the token while handling self-transfer.

These annotations provide a robust framework for ensuring that contracts operate according to the ERC721 standard, suitable for formal verification.

Let's correctly annotate the ERC721 interface with the appropriate formal verification conditions using the `solc-verify` syntax. These postconditions ensure compliance with the ERC721 standard:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

### Explanation
- **`balanceOf`**: The function returns the number of tokens an owner possesses, ensuring `_owner` is non-zero.
- **`ownerOf`**: Assures that the NFT has a valid owner, and `_owner` is accurately returned.
- **`approve`**: Confirms that only the owner or an authorized operator can approve another address to manage the specific token.
- **`getApproved`**: Returns the approved address for a token. If there's no approval, it may return zero.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Marks an operator's approval status for all of the caller’s tokens.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ascertains if an operator can manage all of the enumerated_t balance`.
- **`transferFrom`/`safeTransferFrom`**: These functions manage token transfers, addressing changes in ownership, balancing tokens, and clearing token approval post-transfer.

These annotations ensure the smart contract functions behave as expected according to the ERC721 standard, offering clearly defined constraints and behaviors that can be verified formally.
