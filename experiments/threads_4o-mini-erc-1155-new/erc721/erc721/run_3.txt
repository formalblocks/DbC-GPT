=== USER [2025-04-16 14:27:36] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Here is the `IERC721` smart contract interface annotated with `solc-verify` postconditions. I have carefully included relevant postconditions for each function based on the ERC721 standard and the guideline requirements.

```

### Explanation:
1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the balance reported matches the `_ownedTokensCount` mapping for the given owner and that the owner address is non-zero.

2. **ownerOf**: The function should verify the ownership of a token, ensuring the owner address is correctly matched to `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` and is not zero.

3. **approve**: This function updates the `_tokenApprovals` mapping with the specified approved address for a given `_tokenId`.

4. **getApproved**: The postcondition checks that the approved address is the one set for a particular token ID, as maintained in `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: It ensures that the operator approvals status reflects the desired state and is stored correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that querying an operator's approved status for an owner returns the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**: These closely related functions must decrease the `_ownedTokensCount` for the sender if the sender is not also the recipient and increase for the recipient if the two are different. Also, it ensures the token ownership is correctly transferred.

All specifications follow ERC721 protocols and verify state transitions and side effects resulting from function execution.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:28:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:
1. **balanceOf** and **ownerOf**: Ensure the balance or owner is accurately represented based on the state variables.

2. **approve** and **getApproved**: Make sure approvals are accurately reflected in `_tokenApprovals`.

3. **setApprovalForAll** and **isApprovedForAll**: Validate the operator approvals using `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Verify that tokens are transferred correctly, adjusting `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner` as necessary given whether `_from` is different from `_to`.

The annotations ensure each function operates according to expected behaviors defined by the ERC721 standard, capturing potential changes in the state of the contract accurately. The error in the previous attempt regarding the use of `isApprovedForAll` has been corrected to `result`, which correlates with the intended boolean result.

Here is the `IERC721` smart contract interface with the correct postconditions for formal verification using `solc-verify`. These annotations reflect the expected behavior described in the ERC721 standard for each function, ensuring consistency and correctness as per the task guidelines.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    /**

        * @notice postcondition (__verifier_old_uint(__verifier_old_uint(_tokenOwner[_tokenId])) == msg.sender || _operatorApprovals[__verifier_old_uint(_tokenOwner[_tokenId])][msg.sender])

    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**

        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)

    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
        */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == isApprovedForAll
        */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);

    /**

```

### Key Corrections:
1. **approve**: This function now ensures that the approvable parties are either the owner or an authorized operator. The annotation checks these conditions based on the previous state.

2. **getApproved**: Reflects the approved address state for a token, ensuring it corresponds to the `_tokenOwner` being non-zero.

3. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Confirm the change in ownership and update approval status. Both `_from` and `_to` are handled for self-transfers, preventing unnecessary state changes.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the result accurately indicates whether an operator is approved for a particular owner.

These annotations aim to capture the required logic and satisfy verification tools by considering potential conditions and outcomes based on the contract's state.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:29:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations:
1. **balanceOf** and **ownerOf**: Ensure that balances and ownership accurately reflect the state mappings and that addresses are valid.

2. **approve**: Reflects the approval into the `_tokenApprovals` mapping. Also, ensure that approvals are granted only by the token owner or operators.

3. **getApproved**: Confirms that the approved address set for a token matches the mapping and that the token is owned by an address.

4. **setApprovalForAll**: Sets operator approval and validates it accurately in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the view returns the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

6. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Verify transitions in ownership counting, reset token approvals upon transfer, and ensure correct updates in tokens and ownership reflect state mappings. Special care is taken for self-transfers to maintain consistency.

The annotations now align with the contract state and the specification requirements ensuring correct verification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:29:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the balance reported for an owner matches the `_ownedTokensCount` mapping and the owner address is not zero.
  
- **ownerOf**: Confirms the owner of a given token ID matches what is in the `_tokenOwner` mapping, ensuring it's not the zero address.

- **approve**: Specifies that the approved address for a token is updated in `_tokenApprovals`.

- **getApproved**: Reflects that the returned approved address matches `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`, and verifies the token ID is valid.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Manages operator approval status, updating `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures it correctly queries and returns whether an operator is approved for a given owner.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Handle the transfer of ownership, ensuring decrements and increments in `_ownedTokensCount` occur correctly, account for potential self-transfers, and clear _tokenApprovals for transferred tokens.

These annotations meet the formal specification requirements, directly reflecting the expected state changes imposed by ERC721.

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Checks that the balance accurately reflects the `_ownedTokensCount` and the owner is not the zero address.

- **ownerOf**: Ensures that the owner of the token ID matches `_tokenOwner` and is not the zero address.

- **approve**: Updates `_tokenApprovals` to reflect the new approved address for the token.

- **getApproved**: Ensures that the function returns the approved address for a given token in `_tokenApprovals`, provided the token ID is valid.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Reliably updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping to indicate the approval status of an operator.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms the mapping value reflects whether an operator is approved for all tokens of a given owner.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Handle the transfer logic, ensuring the token ownership is transferred correctly. Balances and token approvals are adjusted only if `_from` and `_to` are different, accounting for self-transfers. The approvals are cleared post-transfer.

These annotations follow the ERC721 standard and ensure each function interacts correctly with the state, reinforcing expected behaviors and maintaining consistency with the interface contract's requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:30:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations and Their Purpose:
- **balanceOf**: Verifies the balance reflects the `_ownedTokensCount` and ensures the owner address is non-zero.

- **ownerOf**: Ensures the correct owner is returned for a given `_tokenId` and that it's not the zero address.

- **approve**: Confirms the right of the sender to approve a transfer, adjusting `_tokenApprovals` properly.

- **getApproved**: Confirms the return of the approved address consistent with  `_tokenApprovals` for the given `_tokenId`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets or revokes operator approval correctly on `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Assures visibility of operator status for all assets of `_owner` relative to `_operator`.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Ensure ownership changes and handle adjustments in `_ownedTokensCount`. They also clear token approvals upon transfer and deal with self-transfer cases to maintain expected state integrity.

The structure matches the standards of ERC721, ensuring the operations maintain contract stability and accurately reflect the functional requirements.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 14:30:50] ===
To ensure the proper use of `solc-verify` for verifying the `IERC721` contract functions, let's correctly annotate each function with appropriate postconditions. We'll adhere to the ERC721 standard and keep conditions consistent across related functions.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

    /**

        * @notice postcondition (_approved == address(0) || _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender])

    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == approved
        */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures the returned `balance` matches the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_owner`, with the additional check that `_owner` is not a zero address.

2. **ownerOf**: Verifies the returned owner for a given `_tokenId` matches the `_tokenOwner` mapping, and that this owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: Ensures `_tokenApprovals` for `_tokenId` matches `_approved`. Adds a condition that the sender should either be the token owner or have operator approval.

4. **getApproved**: Confirms the function returns the correct address in `_tokenApprovals` for a valid `_tokenId`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Verifies that the `_operatorApprovals` status for a given `_operator` and `msg.sender` matches `_approved`.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the function returns whether `_operator` is approved for all operations on `_owner`'s tokens based on `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: These functions maintain consistent state changes for token transfers:
   - Set `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` to `_to`.
   - Adjust `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` and `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` corresponding to the token transfer, handling both regular and self-transfers.
   - Ensure `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is cleared post-transfer.

These postconditions should now properly guide formal verification, reflecting the constraints and expected behaviors as per the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:31:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 14:31:12] ===
To annotate the `IERC721` contract with appropriate formal verification postconditions using `solc-verify`, we ensure each function's behavior matches the ERC721 specification requirements, guarantees state consistency, and correctly uses the state variables and function parameters. Here is the updated contract with correct postconditions:

```solidity

### Key Elements Explained:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures correctness of the balance based on `_ownedTokensCount` and ensures the owner address is valid (non-zero).

2. **ownerOf**: Confirms that the token owner is reflected accurately in `_tokenOwner` and is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: Updates the `_tokenApprovals` mapping for a given token ID, ensuring the sender has authorization (either owns the token or is approved as an operator).

4. **getApproved**: Returns the approved address for a token, ensuring the token is valid (non-zero owner).

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Updates or revokes approval for an operator to manage all assets, represented in `_operatorApprovals`.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the approval status for an operator as stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Handle NFT transfer logic, ensuring ownership and balance are updated correctly. They handle both regular transfers and self-transfer cases appropriately and clear the approval post-transfer. The `safeTransferFrom` functions include a check to ensure `onERC721Received` is called when transferring to a contract that can accept NFTs.

These annotations enhance formal verification, allowing tools to check compliance with ERC721 specifications and maintain the expected behavior of the contract's operations.
