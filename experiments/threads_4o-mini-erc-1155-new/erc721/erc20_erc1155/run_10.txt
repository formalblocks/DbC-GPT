=== USER [2025-04-16 16:25:44] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **balanceOf**: The postcondition states that `_owner` must not be the zero address, and the balance returned is exactly the count of tokens the owner has according to `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Only valid `_tokenId`s should return an owner, which must not be the zero address.

- **approve**: The `_approved` address for the `_tokenId` must be set as indicated. Approve changes must be requested by the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

- **getApproved**: The approved address for a given `_tokenId` retrieves what is stored in `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: The operator approval status should be updated to the provided status, `_approved`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: This method confirms the authorization status of an operator for an owner.

- **transferFrom**: Ensures that the transfer from `_from` to `_to` updates ownership correctly, adjusts token counts, and clears approvals. Throws are handled according to the conditions described in the ERC721 standard.

- **safeTransferFrom**: Handles similar verifications as `transferFrom`, adding verification for zero address checks and ensuring that if `_to` is a contract, the expected `onERC721Received` response is checked.

- **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Incorporates the requirements for both standard `transferFrom` and the data-focused aspects typical in safe transfers, with the additional check when interacting with contracts.

        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation

- **`balanceOf`**: This function checks that the `_owner` is not the zero address and returns the owner count directly as per `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **`ownerOf`**: It verifies that the `_owner` of the given `_tokenId` isn't a zero address.

- **`approve`**: Validates that the `_approved` is the correctly updated approved address for `_tokenId`, and the approval is done either by the owner or by an operator.

- **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address for `_tokenId` is the correct address held in `_tokenApprovals`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that the `_operator` approval status of `_approved` matches the recorded state.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms that the operator's approved status is precisely as maintained in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`transferFrom`**, **`safeTransferFrom`**: Both functions ensure ownership is correctly transferred, balances are accordingly updated, and approval status is cleared as specified. The `_to` must not be the zero address.

- For the `safeTransferFrom` function that includes `bytes calldata _data`, although the specification would be identical to the other `safeTransferFrom` given the tidbit on contracts, extra notes in full implementations usually check contracts' handling via `onERC721Received`.

The conditions are designed based on assumptions about typical ERC721 behavior to fit Solidity verification processes with solc-verify tooling guidelines.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:26:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation and Corrections:

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures `_owner` is not zero and reflects the correct token count.

- **`ownerOf`**: Ensures that any query for `_owner` will return a valid non-zero owner for a token.

- **`approve`**: Sets the approved address properly, ensuring the caller has the right authority to set it.

- **`getApproved`**: Corrects the check on approved addresses, reflecting the actual value in `_tokenApprovals`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Updates `_operatorApprovals` as dictated.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Returns the correct approval status based on `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`transferFrom`**, **`safeTransferFrom`**: Include checks for valid transfer conditions, ensuring ownership is transferred correctly, approval is cleared, and balances updated. The function flags (such as `success` and old counts) ensure the conditions are met, aligning with the standard behavior. 

This adjustment ensures that postconditions correctly reflect contract state changes while maintaining the semantic integrity of token ownership and usability.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.

### Changes Made:

- **`getApproved` and `isApprovedForAll`**: Ensured that conditions validate the relationship directly with existing state variables.
  
- **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**: Addressed correct handling of previous ownership and approvals, and made sure to reset the `_tokenApprovals` post-transfer for compliance.

These annotations now align with typical ERC721 behavior and address the compiler issues by using consistent state variable checks and return conditions.

### Key Changes Made:

- **Variables Consistency**: Ensured that there are no undeclared identifiers and used consistent naming for the return values in the annotations to prevent undefined reference errors.

- **Transfer Functions**: Corrected the postconditions for transfer functions to ensure the balance updates and resetting of approvals aligns with ERC721 behavior.

- **Self Transactions**: Added postcondition logic to confirm sender approval rights, ownership checks, and ensure variable consistency.

These annotations conform to ERC standards by specifying the expected behavior and conditions of functions, aiding in the formal verification process through precise state evaluations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:28:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes:

- **Postconditions for Transfer Functions**: Updated to properly handle self-transfers where `_from` equals `_to`, ensuring no change in ownership counts in such cases.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling logic should be reflected in the logical expressions without causing redundant errors.
- **Postconditions Consistency**: Ensure balance updates, approval resets, and transfer condition checks logically follow ERC721 standards, making them error-free.
  
These modifications aim to ensure that postconditions reflect real, compliant ERC721 behavior, and other contexts such as self-transfers and contract consistency are handled appropriately.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:28:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes:

- **Postcondition Syntax**: Postcondition formatting is consistent and logically complete. Each condition covers all possible outcomes (self-transfer vs. actual transfer).
  
- **Self-Transfer Handling**: Special handling for when `_from` is the same as `_to` ensures no state change occurs while `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` are logically aligned.

- **Logical Completeness**: Postconditions for balance adjustments and ownership transfers were adjusted to ensure that token ownership and authorized transfers are captured comprehensively.

These annotations ensure accurate formal verification of ERC721 operations while maintaining consistency with standard behavior.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Corrections:

- **Postcondition Correction**: Fixed postconditions to use a logical OR condition to handle no change during self-transfers (i.e., `_from` equals `_to`). This ensures the conditions do not yield an erroneous balance change.

- **Proper Function View**: Ensured view functions like `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, and `isApprovedForAll` correctly tie return values to the contract state.

- **Consistent Syntax**: Adjustments in logical expressions to avoid mismatched types or missing constructs.

Postconditions are structured to facilitate formal verification to ensure secure and compliant ERC721 token operations.

### Key Annotations and Conditions Explained:

- **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf`**: Return values are directly related to their respective mappings `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner`.

- **`approve`**: Sets the approved address for a token, ensuring the caller has appropriate rights (as owner or approved operator).

- **`getApproved`**: Retrieves the approved address for an NFT, directly mapping to `_tokenApprovals`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Updates `_operatorApprovals` to reflect the approval status set by the caller.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Queries whether an operator is approved for managing all of the owner's NFTs.

- **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` (both variants)**: Manage transfer semantics including ownership count updates, approval resets, and ownership transfer checks including conditions for self-transfer. These functions ensure that state changes are captured consistently and accurately.

These annotations should align with the ERC721 standard's expectations while allowing formal verification to validate contract behaviors correctly.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:30:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments and Explanations:

- **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf`**: The `balance` and `owner` are directly mapped to their state variables, ensuring they operate according to specification with a valid owner.

- **`approve`**: Approval postcondition checks both the approval being set and the authority of the message sender to do so.

- **`getApproved`**: This directly correlates the return value to the `_tokenApprovals`, ensuring correct state reflection.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensured correct representation of `_operatorApprovals` status after approval or revocation operations.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Fix the equality check to match the boolean return of `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**: Incorporate conditions for `msg.sender` authority and ensure the state changes (ownership counts and resets of `_tokenApprovals`) reflect standard-compliant behavior with a special condition for self-transfers where `_from` is `_to`.

These postconditions conform to expected ERC721 behavior for security assurance and maintain logical integrity for solc-verify.
