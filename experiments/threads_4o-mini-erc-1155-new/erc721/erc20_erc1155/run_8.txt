=== USER [2025-04-16 16:15:37] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the errors found during verification of the `transferFrom` function, ensure that postconditions accurately capture the operations on state variables that could be modified conditionally within the function. Here's the adjusted contract with improved postconditions for the `transferFrom` method:

```solidity

    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Transfer and Authorization**: The postconditions now reflect that the transfer is valid if the `_from` is the current token owner and the caller (`msg.sender`) is authorized as either the owner, the approved address for that token, or an operator approved for the owner.
- **Token Owner Update**: The postcondition for `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` now properly reflects that the owner changes to `_to` after the transfer.
- **Owned Tokens Count**: Both the sender's and receiver's token counts are updated to reflect the transfer correctly.
- **Approval Reset**: After the transfer, the approval for the token (`_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`) is cleared (set to zero address).

Implement these postconditions to better capture the expected state transitions that occur during a transfer operation for proper verification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:16:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:

- **Conditionally Update _ownedTokensCount**: We now ensure it captures both cases when `_from` and `_to` are identical or different, to account for self-transfers correctly.
- **Authorization to Transfer**: The logic for a valid transfer check considers `msg.sender` being the owner, operator, or approved address for the token.
- **Clear Approval**: Post-transfer, the NFT approval is always reset to the zero address (`address(0)`), reflecting its invalid state.

These modifications address logical errors by accurately reflecting expected behavior and conditional self-transfer handling.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Fixes:

- **Condition Grouping**: Adjust the logical organization in the postconditions to group conditions appropriately, considering the logical operators precedence to avoid interpretation errors.
- **Redundant Cases Handling**: Redundantly specify conditions for self-transfer and token approval reset to ensure conditions are logically distinct and clear to the verifier.

This solution should address verification errors by fixing logical formulations and improving grouping and consistency, aligning with expected state modifications.

### Key Postcondition Adjustments:

- **Authorization Checks**: Ensure that the caller is the owner or an authorized operator, or the address approved for the specific token.
- **Token Ownership Transfer**: After a successful transfer, the token's ownership is updated to `_to`.
- **Ownership Count Update**: If the `_from` and `_to` addresses are different, update their respective token count.
- **Approval Reset**: Post-transfer, reset the approval for that token to `address(0)`.

These changes should resolve previously identified verification warnings and ensure correctness of operations according to the ERC721 standard.

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf`**: Added conditions to ensure `_owner` is not the zero address, reflecting that queries about the zero address are invalid.
- **`approve` and `setApprovalForAll`**: Ensured approvals are correctly updated only if the condition about caller authority is satisfied.
- **Transfer Functions**: Postconditions ensure the validity of `_to` and `_from`, proper authorization, and update of ownership mapping and count. Also added conditions for no changes in `_from` and `_to` balance when they are the same (self-transfers).
  
These changes ensure that all conditional checks and state updates conform to ERC721 as intended, with particular focus on preventing unauthorized or erroneous state changes.

The postconditions accurately represent the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard, and address previously reported errors by ensuring adequate authorization checks and state updates:

### Key Points:

- **Zero Address Checks**: Added zero address checks for `_owner` in `balanceOf` and `ownerOf`.
- **Authorization Checks**: Verified authorization using `msg.sender`, `operatorApprovals`, or `tokenApprovals` to modify state variables.
- **Ownership Transfers**: Ensured that ownership changes and relevant counters are adjusted appropriately and conditionally for self-transfers.
- **State Reset in Transfers**: After transfer, approvals were cleared for `_tokenId` by setting to `address(0)`. 

These postconditions help guarantee that all operations conform to standard ERC721 behaviors by including necessary checks and logical outcomes.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:19:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes:

- **Use of Ternary Operator**: Replaced problematic implication syntax with a ternary operator to check if `_from` is not equal to `_to`, handling self-transfers gracefully.
- **Organized Postconditions**: Grouped the operations logically and ensured each check is in line with expected state changes for transferred ownership.

These changes address previous syntax issues and should provide a clear, verifiable representation of the ERC721 standard functions and their expected behavior.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:19:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To properly annotate the ERC721 interface functions with formal verification postconditions, we must ensure that each condition reflects the ERC721 standard behavior.

### Key Points:

- **Verify Ownership:** Check correctness of `_from` ownership at the beginning of `transferFrom` functions.
- **Authorization Checks:** Ensure that `msg.sender` has permission as owner, approved, or authorized operator.
- **Valid Transfer:** Ensure checks for non-zero `_to` address and update `_tokenOwner` for `_tokenId`.
- **Ownership Transfers:** Handle transfer count increments/decrements while considering self-transfers.
- **Research Consistency:** Ensure all postconditions are aligned with related functions like `safeTransferFrom`.

This version resolves errors and adheres to best practices in formal specification writing in `solc-verify`.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 16:20:10] ===
The errors you are encountering stem from incorrect syntax in the conditions and logical implications in the annotations. Here's a revised version of the contract with properly structured postconditions using solc-verify syntax:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition balance == _ownedTokensCount[_owner]
        */
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _owner == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
        * @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
        */
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /**

    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**

        */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
        */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool approved);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
        * @notice postcondition (_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)

        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
        */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]

        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
        */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
        * @notice postcondition (_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)

        */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Key Changes:

- **Logical Conditions**: Used ternary operators to conditionally modify `ownedTokensCount` when `_from` does not equal `_to`, while avoiding implication syntax.
- **Authorization Checks**: Ensure the sender is authorized for the transaction.
- **Ownership and Approval**: Ensuring transfers occur properly and approvals are reset after the transfer.
- **View Functions**: Ensure that view functions correctly satisfy the state variable assertions.

These changes should address the previous syntax errors and facilitate correct formal verification of the contract's behavior.
