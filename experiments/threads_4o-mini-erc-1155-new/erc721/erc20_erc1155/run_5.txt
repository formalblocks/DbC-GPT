=== USER [2025-04-16 16:04:16] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Every function's postconditions now ensure that changes to `_tokenOwner`, `_ownedTokensCount`, `_tokenApprovals`, and `_operatorApprovals` accurately reflect the expected outcomes of their respective operations according to the ERC-721 standard. Additionally, view functions relate return values directly to contract state variables, and conditions handle both successful and unsuccessful execution paths where applicable.

### Explanation of the Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]` is correctly returned as `balance`.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms the returned `_owner` is indeed the `_tokenOwner` for the given `_tokenId`.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Ensures that `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is correctly updated to `_approved`.
   - Confirms that the `_tokenId` is valid (not zero) before performing the approval.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Returns the current approved address for the given `_tokenId`.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping correctly for the sender and the specified `_operator`.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Checks and returns if `_operator` is an approved operator for `_owner`.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Moves the ownership of `_tokenId` from `_from` to `_to`, updating the mappings accordingly.
   - Decreases `_from`'s token count and increases `_to`'s token count.
   - Resets any existing `_tokenApprovals` for the `_tokenId`.

8. **`safeTransferFrom` (both overloads)**:
   - Same ownership changes and approvals reset as `transferFrom`.
   - Handles additional operations for smart contract receivers.

These annotations help ensure the contract holds its integrity with ownership and approvals consistent with the ERC-721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:05:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures the number of tokens `_owner` owns matches the `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Guarantees the contract accurately finds the owner of `_tokenId`.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Confirms approvals are correctly set and can only be set by the owner or an approved operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Checks that the function returns the correct approved address for the `_tokenId`.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Ensures that the operator approval is correctly updated.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Verifies that the approval state is checked and returned accurately.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates appropriate transfer updates: ownerships are changed, balances are adjusted correctly, and approvals for `_tokenId` are reset.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Assures similar conditions as `transferFrom`, but also considers additional safety checks due to possible `onERC721Received` calls. 

These annotations provide a clear mapping of function behavior to contract state and uphold the rules defined by the ERC-721 NFT standard, ensuring consistency and reliability during token transfers and approvals.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures account `_owner` has a valid address and the NFT count matches `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms the function returns the correct `_owner` for `_tokenId`.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Requires authorization (ownership or operator permission) to assign `_approved`.
   - Ensures `_tokenApprovals` is updated accordingly.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Retrieves the correct approved address for a given `_tokenId`.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Accurately updates `_operatorApprovals` for the setting.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Properly checks and returns the operator approval status between two addresses.

7. **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Updates the owner of `_tokenId` to `_to`.
   - Adjusts `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` and `_to`.
   - Resets `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` post-transfer.
  
The annotations thoroughly verify critical contract operations, ensuring function behavior aligns with the NFT ownership tracking contract's logic and expectations, as defined by ERC-721.

### Explanation:
- **General Principles**: 
  - Address the operations that happen before and after each function call.
  - Ensure function assumptions are clear such as `_owner` shouldn't be the zero address for `balanceOf`.
  - Ownership and approval checks for transactions and transfers.
  - Postconditions reflect expected updates of internal mappings after mutations.

- **balanceOf**: 
  - Checks if `_owner` is a valid address and returns the correct token count.

- **ownerOf**:
  - Ensures the `_tokenId` is valid and returns its owner.

- **approve**:
  - Requires `msg.sender` to own the token or be an approved operator and assigns an approved address.

- **getApproved**:
  - Returns the approved address if the token exists.

- **setApprovalForAll**:
  - Sets approval status for an operator.

- **isApprovedForAll**:
  - Returns whether an operator is approved for all of an owner’s assets.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**:
  - Validates the ownership transfer, updates balances accurately, and clears existing approvals.

Note that these annotations ensure that operations on the ERC-721 token contract adhere strictly to the standard, maintaining the integrity of ownership records and access permissions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:07:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- The **balanceOf** function ensures valid ownership address and expected balance.
- The **ownerOf** function validates the existence of the NFT and confirms ownership.
- The **approve** function sets approval for an NFT, requiring ownership or operator permission.
- The **getApproved** function retrieves the approved address if the NFT exists.
- The **setApprovalForAll** function establishes an operator approval state.
- The **isApprovedForAll** function checks and confirms an operator's approved status.
- The **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom** functions enforce proper ownership transfer, update counts respectively, and reset token approvals where necessary.

These changes ensure all state changes adhere to ERC-721 standards and support reliability in ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:08:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

1. **balanceOf**: 
   - Validates the owner address is not zero and confirms the number of owned tokens matches.

2. **ownerOf**:
   - Ensures the queried NFT has an owner and returns the correct owner address.

3. **approve**:
   - Makes sure the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator, and updates the approval state.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Guarantees the NFT has an owner and retrieves the currently approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Updates the operator approval status appropriately.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Returns the operator approval status for the given owner and operator combination.

7. **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom (both versions)**:
   - Ensures the transfer updates ownership correctly, decrements the sender's count if there's a change, increments the recipient's count if applicable, and resets any existing token-specific approvals.

These annotations align with the logic and integrity of the ERC-721 standard, providing a reliable framework for verifying the contract's functionality.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:09:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To accurately annotate the `IERC721` smart contract interface with the required postconditions, we need to ensure that the statements integrate properly with the specified ERC-721 behavior. Here’s how each function within the contract can be annotated:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: The postcondition confirms that the queried `_owner` is not the zero address and that the balance returned matches the `_ownedTokensCount` for that `_owner`.

- **ownerOf**: The function checks if the `_tokenId` has a valid owner and returns that address.

- **approve**: It ensures that either the message sender is the token owner or an authorized operator for the owner of `_tokenId`. It updates `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to `_approved`.

- **getApproved**: Confirms that `_tokenId` is valid (has an owner) and returns the approved address.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets the `_approved` status for the `_operator`, updating `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms if `_operator` is approved to manage all NFTs of `_owner`.

- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom (both versions)**: These functions verify:
  - Ownership transfer (`_to` becomes `_tokenId`'s owner).
  - If `transferFrom`, it accounts for balance changes (decrement `_from`'s count, increment `_to`'s count) but only if `from != to`.
  - Resets any approvals associated with `_tokenId`.

These postconditions ensure that operations on the ERC-721 tokens follow the standard for non-fungible tokens, maintaining the contract's integrity and fulfilling the responsibilities of accurate state transitions and permissions management.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:09:44] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 16:09:49] ===
To effectively annotate the `IERC721` interface with postconditions that comply with both the ERC-721 standard and the solc-verify guidelines, we'll need to use structured logical expressions. These expressions will help ensure that each function behaves as specified in the standard, and we're considering all necessary state transitions.

Here is the updated interface with annotations:

```solidity

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf**: 
   - Ensures the address is valid (non-zero) and the return value accurately reflects the `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**:
   - Verifies the token has a valid owner and returns the owner’s address.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensures that either the caller is the token owner or an authorized operator of the owner, after which it sets the approved address for the token.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Validates the token ownership before returning the approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Appropriately sets the operator approval status for the calling address.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Correctly returns the approval status of an operator for a particular owner.

7. **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**:
   - Validates that the token ownership transfers correctly, including:
     - Adjusted ownership mappings.
     - Reduced count for the sender (except when transferring to self).
     - Increased count for the receiver (except when transferring to self).
     - Clears existing approvals for the token.

These annotations ensure that all relevant state variables are updated according to the rules of ERC-721, preserving the integrity of token ownership and approvals.
