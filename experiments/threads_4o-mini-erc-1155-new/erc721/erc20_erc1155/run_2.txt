=== USER [2025-04-16 15:50:37] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This annotation provides formal verification postconditions for each function in the IERC721 interface. The conditions are based on the ERC721 standard and ensure that the ownership, approvals, and balances behave as expected after each function executes.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:50:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

In these annotations, I've ensured that each function has postconditions that reflect the ERC721 standard behavior for the relevant state changes or returns. Each function's outcome is consistently asserted in relation to what the ERC721 definitions specify.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:51:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

In this version, I've added conditions for self-transfers (when `_from` is equal to `_to`) in the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions to address the verifier error. This ensures that the balance remains consistent for self-transfers, as no actual transfer occurs in those cases.

### Explanation
- **balanceOf**: Ensures `_owner` is not zero and returns the correct count from `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf**: Confirms that the `_tokenId` has an owner and returns the owner address.
- **approve**: Sets the `_tokenApprovals` correctly if `msg.sender` is authorized.
- **getApproved**: Ensures validity of `_tokenId` and returns its approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates `_operatorApprovals` as specified.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures it returns the status of `_operatorApproval`.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Handles transfer logic, including self-transfers where `_from` equals `_to`, and resets the approval for the `_tokenId`. The balances are correctly updated if `_from` and `_to` are different.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:52:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:
- **approve**: Checks if the sender is authorized to approve the `_tokenId`. If so, it sets the `_tokenApprovals`, otherwise it reverts to its previous state.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Corrected to ensure that it properly checks and verifies operator approvals against state variables.

This complete and consistent specification reflects the expected behavior per the ERC721 standard and focuses on maintaining consistency in state updates and query functions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:52:25] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 15:52:27] ===
To address the errors and apply appropriate postconditions following proper solc-verify syntax, we need to ensure we are accurately reflecting state changes while maintaining type consistency. Here's the revised annotation for each function in the `IERC721` interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    /**

    /**

        */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == approved
        */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**

    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApproved);

        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
        */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
        * @notice postcondition (_from == _to && _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from])) || (_from != _to && _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1)

        */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}

```

### Key Adjustments:
- **approve**: Adjusted postcondition to check if `_approved` is set only when the sender is the owner or an approved operator; otherwise, it should remain unchanged.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Clarified to ensure consistency by using the variable `isApproved` to match the return behavior.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Modified to handle both the case where `_from` and `_to` are the same (no change in balance) and when they are different (balance adjusted accordingly).

These postconditions now accurately track state changes while adhering to the verification guidelines.

Let's properly annotate the `IERC721` smart contract interface with formal verification postconditions for each function as per the ERC721 standard, paying attention to return values and correctly representing state transitions.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;

```

### Corrections and Clarifications:
- **approve**: The postcondition specifies when `_approved` should actually update the mapping, ensuring that only valid senders can make changes.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensured it refers correctly to returning a boolean as `result`, conveying whether an operator is approved.
- **self-transfers in transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**: Addressed by checking if `_from` and `_to` are the same, meaning no balances change.

These postconditions help represent the logical expectations for each function while maintaining the relationships between the various mappings and state variables.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:52:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf** and **ownerOf**: These functions retrieve state information, so their postconditions focus on matching return values directly with corresponding state variables.
- **approve**, **setApprovalForAll**, and **isApprovedForAll**: These functions deal with setting up approvals. Postconditions ensure the approvals state maps correctly to input parameters, making conditions check whether post-operation state is consistent with what's expected.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Ensure correct update of ownership and balances, especially in the context of self-transfers where `_from` equals `_to`.

These annotations verify the function's effects on contract state and help ensure adherence to expected behavior per the ERC721 standard.

Here are the formal verification postconditions for the `IERC721` contract that need to be added to each function. These postconditions are determined based on the ERC721 standard to ensure correctness and consistency of token behavior.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;

```

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf** and **ownerOf**: Directly relate the balance and owner to the values stored in `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner`.
- **approve** and **getApproved**: Ensure `_tokenApprovals` is updated only when conditions are met or remains unchanged. The `getApproved` function relates the return value directly with `_tokenApprovals`.
- **setApprovalForAll** and **isApprovedForAll**: Ensure that `_operatorApprovals` is updated and queried correctly.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Check changes to ownership and count, while accounting for non-changing cases in self-transfers.

These annotations ensure that functions adhere to the expected behaviors as defined in the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:53:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Notes:
- The postconditions are constructed to ensure the integrity of the contract's internal state based on the function's expected effects.
- Each function's conditions verify that changes to mappings (_tokenOwner, _tokenApprovals, _ownedTokensCount, _operatorApprovals) align correctly with the function's intended behavior.
- The verification handles self-transfers by recognizing when `_from` is equal to `_to`, ensuring that balances remain unchanged in those scenarios.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Corrected to match the expected naming convention and ensured return values match the state.

These annotations aim to directly reflect and enforce the standard and anticipated behavior of ERC721 functions.
