=== USER [2025-04-16 16:10:14] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This specification includes the necessary postconditions for each function based on the typical behavior of ERC721 contracts, ensuring alignment with the standard's requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:10:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These postconditions ensure that each function correctly reflects changes to the state variables on successful execution, matching the expected behavior outlined in the ERC721 standard. Additionally, they handle both the simple token transfer among distinct parties, and self-transfers, along with the setting and approval of token handlers.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:11:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Each postcondition above is designed to ensure that the internal state of the contract reflects the expected changes after executing each function. For functions where authorization is needed, it assures that conditions on allowed actions are verified. For transfers, it handles NFT ownership and balances correctly, ensuring no tokens are lost or incorrectly accounted for.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:11:43] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To craft proper postconditions for the given ERC-721 contract functions, we need to ensure the postconditions accurately reflect state changes and access controls post-execution. I will adjust the previous annotations considering these aspects and ensure the functions mention any necessary access control conditions more clearly.

**Key Corrections:**

- **Ownership Updates**: Ensure that `_tokenOwner` reflects `_to` post-transfer.
- **Balance Adjustments**: `_ownedTokensCount` of `_from` and `_to` reflect the true state after a transfer.
- **Authorization Check**: Transfers only proceed if the caller is authorized, ensuring security principles are respected.
- **Self-transfer Handling**: Handle scenarios where `_from` equals `_to`.
- **Approval Reset**: Ensure that post-transfer, approvals on the token are reset for security.

The postconditions now should reflect expected results for transfers based on ownership and balance, integration with the ERC-721 standard appropriately, and ensuring checks on access control are validated.

### Key Points:
- These postconditions include checks to ensure functions don't operate on invalid (`address(0)`) or non-existent tokens.
- Authorization checks are included to maintain proper permissions handling.
- Success and failure cases are specifically handled, ensuring logical consistency for both successful operations and failure scenarios.
- Ownership and balance changes reflect accurately based on transfers.

These annotations should provide a robust verification logic aligning with the ERC-721 specifications, ensuring that operations are correctly constrained and validated.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:12:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Components Explained:
- **Function Return vs State**:
  - **balanceOf**: Directly relates the returned balance to stored balance data (`_ownedTokensCount`).
  - **ownerOf**: Maps `tokenId` to its current owner in `_tokenOwner`.

- **Authorization**:
  - **approve** and **setApprovalForAll**: Check that only authorized individuals can modify approvals.
  - **getApproved** and **isApprovedForAll** ensure the returned approved addresses match current stored values.

- **State Updates**:
  - **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: These manage token changes hands between owners and must reset approvals post-transfer. They also adjust the owned token counts accordingly, with special logic for self-transfers where `_from == _to`.

These annotations correctly represent the state changes and constraints expected from a compliant ERC721 contract.
