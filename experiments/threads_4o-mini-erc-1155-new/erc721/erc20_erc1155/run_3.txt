=== USER [2025-04-16 15:54:23] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations define the expected behavior of each function post-execution, helping ensure the contract adheres to the ERC-721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:54:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This version ensures the annotations reflect the correct use of parameter names in the postconditions for each function, as well as accurately verifying expected state variable behaviors according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:55:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations represent the expected behavior of each function based on the state changes and verifications required by the ERC721 standard. They capture changes to the state variables that occur during execution and ensure consistency and validity of operations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:55:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **View Functions:** `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, and `isApprovedForAll` have postconditions that directly relate the function return values to their respective state variables.
- **State-Modification Functions:** 
  - `approve`, `setApprovalForAll`, `transferFrom`, and both versions of `safeTransferFrom` manage updates to `_tokenApprovals`, `_operatorApprovals`, and ownership mappings.
  - `transferFrom` ensures the state update of owner transfer and approval reset.
  - Annotations include previous state references using `__verifier_old_uint` for verification of correct balance adjustments.

These annotations accurately describe the expected impacts of function execution, aligning with ERC721's standards for non-fungible tokens.


=== USER [2025-04-16 15:56:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

- **balanceOf** and **ownerOf** give a direct relationship between function return values and state variables.
- **approve** and **setApprovalForAll** show that the approvals are set correctly in the mappings.
- **isApprovedForAll** checks the mapping for the operator.
- **transferFrom** and both variants of **safeTransferFrom** have postconditions checking:
  - The owner of the token is updated.
  - Previous approvals are cleared.
  - Tokens are correctly transferred between owners, updating counts.
  - All transfer conditions plus approvals or ownership authority conditions are maintained throughout.

These annotations capture the intended behavior for each method per the ERC721 specification, aiding in formal verification to help ensure correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:57:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- **Mapping Validity:** The annotations ensure that mappings (like `_tokenOwner`, `_tokenApprovals`, `_ownedTokensCount`, `_operatorApprovals`) are updated according to the ERC721 specification after each transaction.
- **Ownership Transfers:** `transferFrom` and both `safeTransferFrom` methods include postconditions ensuring ownership transfer updates are correct.
- **Approval Management:** `approve` and `setApprovalForAll` ensure that the appropriate approvals are correctly set or cleared.
- **Address Validations:** Postconditions confirm state changes and ensure operations, like zero address checks, follow the ERC rules.

These annotations ensure contract methods change the state as required and support formal verification using solc-verify.

### Notable Aspects:

- **Zero Address Checks:** Ensure that `_owner` and `_to` are not zero addresses where applicable, adhering to ERC721 rules to prevent invalid operations.
- **Ownership Assertions:** For transfer functions, confirm the ownership updates post-transfer reflect the expected state adjustments in terms of ownership count and token approval resets. 
- **Approval updates in `approve` and `setApprovalForAll`:** Check that approval changes are correctly reflected in internal mappings.
- **Invariants on Views:** Confirm view functions reflect direct correlations between state and return values, maintaining consistency.
  
This version contains corrections for lifecycle functions and validation checks, ensuring they execute in a logically consistent manner relative to the token standard's expectations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:58:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Considerations:

- **Address Validations:** Ensure `_owner` and `_to` are not zero addresses, as per ERC721 requirements.
- **Ownership Validity:** The pre-transfer owner is verified before any transfer operation, ensuring legitimate transfer between correct accounts.
- **Operator Approvals:** Check correct conditions regarding who can transfer the token, indicating ownership or delegate approval.
- **Transfer Postconditions:** Capture the correct update to mappings post-transfer, ensuring token and approval mappings reflect accurate state after operations.

This build ensures that the implementation reflects the intended logic and data consistency as guided by ERC721, facilitating formal verification to assert contract correctness.
