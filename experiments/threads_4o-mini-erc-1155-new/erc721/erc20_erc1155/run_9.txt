=== USER [2025-04-16 16:20:38] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
1. **Ownership Functions**: 
   - For `balanceOf`, we ensure that the balance returned corresponds to the internal `_ownedTokensCount` mapping.
   - For `ownerOf`, it reflects the correct `_tokenOwner` of the given NFT.

2. **Approval Functions**:
   - `approve` ensures that the approved address for a token is correctly set in `_tokenApprovals` and `msg.sender` is the current owner.
   - `getApproved` should confirm the approved address for a token ID.

3. **Operator Functions**:
   - `setApprovalForAll` modifies the `_operatorApprovals` mapping to reflect the new approval status.
   - `isApprovedForAll` checks if an operator is authorized for a certain owner.

4. **Transfer Functions**:
   - Both `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` ensure that the token ownership is correctly transferred from `_from` to `_to` and adjust `_ownedTokensCount` accordingly.
   - They reset `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to zero upon transfer, respecting the ERC-721 conditions.

These annotations aim to reflect the accurate expected behavior according to the ERC-721 interface specification.

Let’s proceed by correctly specifying formal postconditions using solc-verify for the `IERC721` contract. The postconditions need to reflect the intended behavior dictated by the ERC-721 standard. Specifically, we need to ensure that state transitions are accurately represented. Let's see the postconditions for each function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

        */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external {
        //$ Implementation is not provided here as it is an interface

    }

    /**

```

### Explanation:
- **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf`:** These simply return state variables, linking return values to the internal mappings.
- **`approve`:** We ensure the called function sets the approved address correctly. The caller must have proper clearance (either as the owner or as an authorized operator).
- **`getApproved`:** Validates that the return matches the internal approvals mapping.
- **`setApprovalForAll`:** Confirms the authorization status of an operator is effectively toggled.
- **`isApprovedForAll`:** Links the return value directly to the state variable.
- **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`:** Requires that ownership changes are reflected in `_tokenOwner` and `_ownedTokensCount`, resetting `_tokenApprovals` post-transfer.

These postconditions ensure that state transitions and data consistency in the smart contract align with the ERC-721 specification. Correct application of postconditions ensures that the implementation respects specified behavior.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:21:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
1. **Ownership and Approvals**:
   - `balanceOf` verifies the balance equals the internal `_ownedTokensCount`.
   - `ownerOf` confirms that the returned owner matches `_tokenOwner`.

2. **Approvals**:
   - `approve` updates the `_tokenApprovals` mapping only if the caller is authorized.
   - `getApproved` ensures correct return of approved address.

3. **Operator Functions**:
   - `setApprovalForAll` reflects the new state of operator approval.
   - `isApprovedForAll` maintains the correct relation between return value and mapping.

4. **Transfers**:
   - `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` ensure token ownership is transferred, updating `_ownedTokensCount` and resetting approvals.
   - Use logical implications `_from != _to` to impact counters only when sending to a new address, reflecting self-transfer logic.

These annotations reflect the conditions post-execution, addressing potential state changes and expected behavior per ERC-721 rules.

### Explanation:
1. **Ownership and Correct Address Checks**:
   - **`balanceOf`** and **`ownerOf`** should assert that the owner address is not zero and correctly reflects the count and ownership mappings.
   
2. **Approval Functions**:
   - For **`approve`**, ensure that the setting of an approved address is only permissible if the caller is the owner or an authorized operator.
   - **`getApproved`** must return the correct approved address per the mapping.

3. **Operator Functions**:
   - **`setApprovalForAll`** updates the mapping for the operator's approved status.
   - **`isApprovedForAll`** directly relates the approved status of a given operator to the stored mapping.

4. **Transfer Functions**:
   - Both **`transferFrom`** and **`safeTransferFrom`** functions assure that token ownership transitions (from `_from` to `_to`) are reflected in the mappings, the count is updated accordingly when necessary, and approvals are reset.
   - Incorporating correct handling for self-transfers and ensuring no change in ownership count if `_from` equals `_to`.

These postconditions provide validity over the expected states and changes, aligning with the ERC-721 standard while adhering to formal verification needs.

To add appropriate formal verification conditions (postconditions) for the `IERC721` contract functions using `solc-verify`, we must ensure the conditions adhere to the ERC-721 standard while aligning with the `solc-verify` verification guidelines. Let's annotate each function.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

### Explanation:
1. **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf`:**
   - These functions confirm direct relations between the internal state (mappings) and the return values.
   - They assert that zero addresses are invalid.

2. **`approve`:**
   - Ensures that the caller must be the owner or an approved operator and clarifies that the new approval reflects in `_tokenApprovals`.

3. **`getApproved`:**
   - Confirms simple access of evaluations to return the address stored in `_tokenApprovals`.

4. **`setApprovalForAll`:**
   - Reflects correctly setting or revoking operator approval.

5. **`isApprovedForAll`:**
   - Maps the returned boolean status to the storing mapping’s state.

6. **Transfers:**
   - Enforce address validity, ensure proper ownership transfer, and count adjustment only when `_from` and `_to` are different, while also resetting approvals.
   - Ensure there are no changes in balances when transferring to and from the same address (`_from == _to`).

These postconditions help describe and enforce the expected behavior of each function defined in the ERC-721 standard within the `IERC721` interface, promoting reliable formal verification processes.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:23:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
1. **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf`:**
   - Ensure the returned balance correctly reflects the mapping and owner can't be a zero address.

2. **`approve`:**
   - Makes sure that approval happens only if the caller is the owner or authorized operator, and the token exists.

3. **`getApproved`:**
   - Simple access of approval state.

4. **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`:**
   - Sets and checks operator approval correctly.

5. **Transfers (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom` without or with data):**
   - Validate non-zero target address.
   - Handle self-transfer logic by ensuring no balance change when `_from` equals `_to`.
   - Ensure proper update/reset of ownership and approval status.

These postconditions aim to accurately follow the ERC-721 standard and assist in verifying the intended state changes in the contract with formal methods.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:23:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 16:23:49] ===
To annotate the `IERC721` contract interface with proper formal verification conditions (postconditions), we will apply the ERC-721 standard principles while ensuring formal correctness with `solc-verify`. Here, I'll provide postconditions that reflect the contract's state after executing each function, ensuring they align with the ERC standard.

```solidity

### Explanation:

1. **View Functions (`balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, and `isApprovedForAll`):**
   - Ensure the state is queried correctly, reflecting the internal mappings of the contract with conditions preventing invalid states involving a zero address owner.
   - Use postconditions that match each function's purpose, ensuring they return values directly correlating with state variables.

2. **Mutative Functions (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`, and transfer functions):**
   - Capture the state changes regarding approvals or token ownership transfers.
   - For `approve`, ensure the caller is allowed to approve the token.
   - For transfers (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`), ensure the ownership transfer is reflected correctly unless the transfer fails.
   - Handle self-transfers where applicable and reset the `_tokenApprovals` mapping.
   - Include `!success || (_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _from)` to capture failure cases with the success logic.

These postconditions ensure proper representation of the intended behavior of ERC-721 functions, handling consistent and specified state transitions after each contract interaction.

To properly annotate the `IERC721` contract with formal verification conditions using the `solc-verify` syntax, we will add postconditions that reflect the expected behavior as per the ERC-721 standard. These annotations will help ensure that the contract behaves correctly and efficiently.

### Explanation:
1. **Balance and Ownership Queries:**
   - The `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` functions make sure that the owner's balance or token owner is accurately reflected and valid (not zero).

2. **Approval Functions:**
   - `approve` ensures only valid and authorized approvals, setting the `_tokenApprovals` mapping.
   - `getApproved` confirms the approved address mirrors `_tokenApprovals`.

3. **Operator Approvals:**
   - `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` correctly set and reflect the state of operator approvals.

4. **Transfer Functions:**
   - All transfer functions (`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`) confirm token ownership changes with proper recipient validation.
   - Handle self-transfers, ensuring no count changes when `_from` equals `_to`.
   - Reset `_tokenApprovals` and verify successful transfers update the corresponding owner mapping.

These conditions reflect the contract's expected compliance with the ERC-721 standard, offering both state validation and operational correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:24:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To correctly annotate the `IERC721` interface with formal verification postconditions using `solc-verify`, we'll adhere strictly to the ERC-721 standard while ensuring consistency and proper handling of expected state transitions. Here's a revised approach for the annotations:

```solidity

    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**

        */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

```

### Explanation:
1. **Balancing Conditions:**
   - **`balanceOf`** ensures that the balance accurately reflects `_ownedTokensCount` and that the owner is not a zero address.
   - **`ownerOf`** guarantees the owner of the token is not a zero address and ensures the owner field matches `_tokenOwner`.

2. **Approvals:**
   - **`approve`** requires the caller to own the token or be an authorized operator while setting `_tokenApprovals`.
   - **`getApproved`** must return the approved address, which is in `_tokenApprovals`.

3. **Operator Approvals:**
   - **`setApprovalForAll`** reflects the change in operator approvals.
   - **`isApprovedForAll`** returns if an operator is authorized for a certain owner.

4. **Transfers:**
   - **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`** include checks that `_to` is not the zero address, ownership changes occur correctly, approvals are reset, and ownership counts adjust if `_from` is not equal to `_to`.

This approach adheres to the defined guidelines and ensures each function is annotated to reflect the correct behavior per ERC-721 standards.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 16:25:18] ===
To annotate the `IERC721` interface with formal verification conditions using the `solc-verify` syntax, let's provide contextually accurate postconditions that reflect the expected behavior per the ERC-721 standard. Here's a refined version:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_owner] == balance
        */
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _owner
        * @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
        */
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition (_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender]) && _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved
        */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == approved
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)
        */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
        */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
        */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
        * @notice postcondition (_to != address(0)) && (_from == _to || _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1)
        * @notice postcondition (_from == _to || _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1)
        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
        * @notice postcondition (_from != _to) || (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]))
        */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
        * @notice postcondition (_to != address(0)) && (_from == _to || _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1)
        * @notice postcondition (_from == _to || _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1)
        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
        * @notice postcondition (_from != _to) || (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]))
        */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
        * @notice postcondition (_to != address(0)) && (_from == _to || _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1)
        * @notice postcondition (_from == _to || _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1)
        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
        * @notice postcondition (_from != _to) || (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]))
        */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}

```

### Notes:

1. **Postconditions for `balanceOf` and `ownerOf`:**
   - Ensure non-zero addresses and accurate reflection of mappings.

2. **Postconditions for Approval and Transfer:**
   - Ensure correct state after operations.
   - `approve` ensures the approver has proper authorization.
   - All transfers confirm ownership changes, manage balance updates, restrict to valid (`_to != address(0)`) non-self-transfers.
   - Self-transfers (`_from == _to`) do not change counts but reset `_tokenApprovals` correctly.

3. **Postconditions for Operator Approvals:**
   - Ensure `setApprovalForAll` changes `_operatorApprovals`.
   - Reflect `isApprovedForAll` accurately in return value.

These annotations are designed to align with the expected behaviors as defined in ERC-721, strengthening correctness assurances and improving consistency across related functions.
