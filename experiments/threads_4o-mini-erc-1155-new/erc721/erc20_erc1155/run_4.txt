=== USER [2025-04-16 15:58:50] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation of the Postconditions:

- `balanceOf`: Ensures the returned balance matches the `_ownedTokensCount` of `_owner`.

- `ownerOf`: Confirms that the returned owner of a token is exactly `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.

- `approve`: Ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator and updates `_tokenApprovals` for the `_tokenId`.

- `getApproved`: Ensures the returned approved address for the `_tokenId` is accurate as recorded in `_tokenApprovals`.

- `setApprovalForAll`: Ensures the state of `operatorApprovals` is correctly set for the given operator.

- `isApprovedForAll`: Confirms the returned boolean matches `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

- `transferFrom`: Validates the caller's authorization to transfer and ensures the ownership transfer from `_from` to `_to` is conducted correctly, updating counts.

- `safeTransferFrom`: Both overloads ensure secure token transfer from `_from` to `_to`, checking for authorization and valid changes to `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:59:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Below are the revised formal verification conditions (postconditions) for the `IERC721` smart contract interface. These postconditions adhere to the ERC721 standard and are designed to ensure that the smart contract operates as expected. Additionally, the problematic postconditions in `transferFrom` have been corrected.

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Relates to the number of NFTs owned by an address. The postcondition ensures the returned balance matches `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Asserts that the returned owner corresponds correctly with `_tokenOwner`.

- **approve**: Validates that either the sender is the token owner or an approved operator for the token. Then, it ensures that the `_tokenApprovals` mapping reflects the approval.

- **getApproved**: Provides the approved address from `_tokenApprovals`, ensuring its correctness.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures the `_operatorApprovals` state is updated correctly for the given operator.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies the boolean returned matches the `_operatorApprovals`.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Both versions check that:
  - The recipient is not the zero address.
  - The sender (or approved party) has the authority to transfer the `_tokenId`.
  - The token ownership is transferred from `_from` to `_to`.
  - The token count is properly updated, balancing counts between sender and recipient.
  
These conditions ensure comprehensive coverage of the expected behavior for the ERC721 implementation.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:59:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom (both versions)**:
  - Included condition ensuring only authorized users (token owner, approved user, or operator) can initiate transfers, and checks for `_to` being a valid address.
  - Managed self-transfer by maintaining balance conditions if `_from` equals `_to`.
  - Added a `success` boolean to handle postcondition satisfaction in both successful and failed operations.

These changes aim to correct the issues by guaranteeing conditions that remain valid through various execution paths, ensuring safe and compliant interactions according to the ERC721 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.

        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 16:00:27] ===
The errors you're encountering are due to missing declarations and usage of undeclared variables. Let's address these errors by adjusting the syntax and ensuring all used identifiers exist within the context of verification. The `success` variable was referenced but not defined; therefore, it caused an undeclared identifier error.

Below is the updated code for your ERC721 functions with postconditions specified correctly:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /**

    /**

        * @notice postcondition _approved == address(0) || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved
        */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
        */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**

        */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

**Key Adjustments:**
- Removed the undeclared `success` term.
- Ensured all postconditions check valid state transitions especially regarding ownership, approval, and recipient validity.
- The functions do not necessarily need to return `bool success` unless they are designed to do so; hence, postconditions reflect checks that are expected for function bodies.
- Improved clarity for checks against `address(0)` and consistent transition from `_from` to `_to` handling `_tokenOwner` crossovers and access checks.

These updates should help resolve translation and verification issues while keeping the contract consistent with ERC721 standards.

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the total count of NFTs owned by `_owner`.

- **ownerOf**: Confirms that `_owner` is the owner of `_tokenId`.

- **approve**: Validates that the caller is allowed to approve the specified `_tokenId` and assigns `_approved` to assigned approvals.

- **getApproved**: Ensures the retrieved approved address is as expected.

- **setApprovalForAll** and **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies that operator approvals are correctly assigned or read.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Both operations ensure:
  - Authorization of the `msg.sender` to transfer.
  - Ownership transfer to `_to`, with `_from` as current owner and `_to` not being zero address.
  - Proper token ownership transition and accounting.

These postconditions lay the groundwork for robust, safe, and standards-compliant ERC721 functionality, covering authorization, balance updates, and transfer semantics.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:01:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- **transferFrom**, **safeTransferFrom**:
  - The postconditions check that the caller is authorized to transfer (`msg.sender` is either the owner, an approved address, or an operator), ensuring `_from` is the current owner.
  - Ensure `_to` is not the zero address.
  - Verify that `_tokenId` is moved to the `_to` address.
  - Checks relate previous state ownership counts for internal consistency.

These annotations provide robust verification that encapsulates typical ownership and permission checks, as expected by ERC721. They also respect postconditions for each permissible execution state, ensuring that the balance states remain valid throughout the lifecycle of a token transfer.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 16:02:07] ===
The errors you're encountering indicate that there are undeclared variables and issues in translating the specifications for the functions. Let's carefully correct the postconditions for each function in the `IERC721` smart contract to make sure they reflect proper authorization checks and consistent ownership change. Also, note that the `success` variable isn't typically defined in Solidity interfaces — it would usually be part of a function implementation. In this case, the focus is on verifying expected postcondition states.

Here's how you can annotate this smart contract interface with proper formal verification postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_owner] == balance
        */
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _owner
        */
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender]
        * @notice postcondition _approved == address(0) || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved
        */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
        */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
        */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
        */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool approved);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
        * @notice postcondition msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender
        * @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
        * @notice postcondition (_from == _to) || (_from != _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) == _ownedTokensCount[_from] + 1)
        * @notice postcondition (_from == _to) || (_from != _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) == _ownedTokensCount[_to] - 1)
        */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
        * @notice postcondition msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender
        * @notice postcondition _to != address(0)

        * @notice postcondition (_from == _to) || (_from != _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) == _ownedTokensCount[_to] - 1)
        */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
        * @notice postcondition msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender

        * @notice postcondition (_from == _to) || (_from != _to && __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) == _ownedTokensCount[_to] - 1)
        */
   function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}

```

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the queried owner isn't zero, and the token count corresponds to `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Confirms that `_owner` is correctly queried from `_tokenOwner`.

- **approve**: Ensures that the caller is the token owner or an approved operator and sets `_tokenApprovals` for `_tokenId`.

- **getApproved**: Returns the approved address directly from the `_tokenApprovals` mapping.

- **setApprovalForAll** and **isApprovedForAll**: Verify that operator approvals are correctly assigned and queried.

- **transferFrom, safeTransferFrom**:
  - Ensure the transferring address is valid and authorized.
  - Verify that `_from` is the owner, `_to` is a valid address, and if transferring to a new owner, update ownership mappings and balances accordingly.
  - Maintain balance consistency, especially handling self-transfer conditions where `_from == _to`.

These annotations use postconditions to verify ownership through state changes, which is central to ERC721 compliance, and manage account balances correctly during token transfer processes.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:02:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To correctly annotate the smart contract with formal verification postconditions, you need to ensure that each function in the `IERC721` interface reflects the expected behavior as defined by the ERC721 standard. The key aspects to check include ownership, authorization, and state changes during token transfer. Here's the corrected version with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**

```

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf**: Returns the number of tokens owned by `_owner`, validated by `_ownedTokensCount`.
  
- **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner matches the entry in `_tokenOwner`.

- **approve**: Validates that either the sender is the owner or an approved operator. Approvals should reflect changes or reset if set to the zero address.

- **getApproved**: Directly retrieves the approved address from `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll / isApprovedForAll**: Set and check approvals of a designated operator for all tokens owned by a user.

- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**:
  - Ensure the authorization of the transfer via the caller's permissions or pre-approved rights.
  - Confirm ownership has shifted from `_from` to `_to` and that the transfer is only performed between valid addresses (non-zero addresses).
  - Handle the conditional accounting for ownership counters, maintaining internal count integrity.

These postconditions ensure the correct order of operations and validate safe transitions according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:03:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Considerations:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures `_owner` is not a zero address and the balance relates directly to `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Confirms the owner for `_tokenId` and checks it's not assigned to an invalid address.

- **approve**: Validates that only the token owner or an approved operator can set `_tokenApprovals`.

- **getApproved**: Confirms that the returned `approved` address matches `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll / isApprovedForAll**: Verifies setting and retrieving approvals for operators.

- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**: These functions validate:
  - `_from` is the current owner of `_tokenId`.
  - Operation authorization for the sender.
  - That `_to` is a non-zero address.
  - Proper assignment of the new owner.
  - Consistency in accounting for `_ownedTokensCount`, whether the transfer is self-directed or not.

These conditions ensure adherence to ERC721 semantics, providing robustness against unauthorized transfers and maintaining balance integrity.

To ensure that formal verification through postconditions is consistent with the ERC721 standard, we need to address the error observed in the `transferFrom` function. This mainly involves ensuring proper authorization checks are in place.

Below is the revised code with formal verification conditions for each function, focusing on ownership, approval, and transfer logic:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /**

    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**

        */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**

        */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]` reflects the correct balance and checks `_owner` validity.

- **ownerOf**: Confirms the returned owner corresponds correctly to `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` and is not zero.

- **approve**: Checks that only the owner or an operator of the owner can approve a new address, and updates `_tokenApprovals`.

- **getApproved**: Simply returns the approved address as per `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll / isApprovedForAll**: Modify and return operator approval status correctly.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom** (both versions):
  - Confirm the transfer's authority is valid, whether by ownership or operator status.
  - Validate that `_to` is a non-zero address.
  - Execute a proper update of ownership mappings and account balance when tokens are transferred from one owner to another.

These conditions ensure compliance with expected ERC721 behaviors and verify safe execution pathways for token transfers and related permission changes.
