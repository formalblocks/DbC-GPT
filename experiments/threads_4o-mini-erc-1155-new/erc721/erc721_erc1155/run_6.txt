    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This code now is equipped with formal verification conditions specified as postconditions for each function. These conditions specify the expected behavior of the function as per the ERC-721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:51:08] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Details:
- **Balance / Ownership Checks**: Functions were annotated to ensure state variables correspond correctly to ownership counts and approved entities.
- **Self-transfers**: Special conditions were added to handle self-transfers where _from and _to are the same.
- **Error Resilience**: Ensured preconditions such as address non-zero checks are mentioned to align with the standard's throw clauses.
- **Consistency**: Maintained consistent logic between `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` regarding ownership and balance changes.

### Notes on Annotations:
- **Address Validations**: Checks are included to ensure `_owner`, `_from`, and `_to` are not zero addresses, aligning with standard checks to throw for invalid scenarios.
- **Transfer Invariants**: Ensure that ownership and balances reflect the expected changes, accounting for both the scenario of transferring to the same address (self-transfer) where no state change occurs.
- **View Functions**: The returned values in view functions are related directly to state variables as required.
- **Consistency in Transfers**: `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` have consistent postconditions to maintain standard token movement logic.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:52:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Details:

- **Address Checks**: The `_from` and `_to` addresses are verified to be non-zero in both `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`.

- **Balance Updates**: The `_ownedTokensCount` mappings are updated as per the transfer of ownership. For self-transfers, the count remains unchanged.

- **State Verification**: Ensures `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` reflects the new owner's address after a transfer, maintaining integrity across transfer functions.

- **Operator Approval**: The postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` asserts that the result matches the mappings state.

This specification guarantees that the contract behaves in accordance with the ERC-721 standard and reflects proper state updates during transactions.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

### Explanation:

- **Address Validity**: Address checks are included in `balanceOf`, `transferFrom`, and `safeTransferFrom` to ensure valid addresses.
  
- **Balance Changes**: The change in `_ownedTokensCount` is reflected for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions, replacing previous balance calculations when `_from` and `_to` are different.

- **Ownership Assignment**: Ensures `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` is updated to address `_to` after successful transfers.

- **View Functions**: The result of `balanceOf` and `isApprovedForAll` is tied to their respective state variables, ensuring consistency with the Ethereum standard.

With these conditions, you make certain that the essential state transitions and checks are logically sound and adhere to the functionality expected by ERC-721.

### Key Details:

- **Ownership Validation**: Ensure `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` is updated to the new owner after a transfer.
  
- **Balance Verification**: For balance changes, use the old value to show it decrements for `_from` and increments for `_to`, except in self-transfers (`_from == _to`).

- **Address Validity**: Ensures `_from` and `_to` are not zero addresses for all applicable functions.
  
- **Approval Logic**: Correctly reflect changes following the approval process.

These postconditions ensure the contract operations respect the ERC-721 standard and maintain state integrity through each function's operation.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:53:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Balance and Ownership Checks**: Functions like `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` are designed to confirm the correct owner and balances, ensuring they align with the `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner` state variables.
  
- **Approval and Ownership Changes**: The `approve` and transfer functions (`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`) are annotated to reflect changes in ownership and approvals, capturing conditions like decrementing the sender's balance and incrementing the recipient's balance only when they are not the same (`_from != _to`).

- **Transfer Conditions**: The transfer methods ensure postconditions handle cases where the from and to addresses are the same (self-transfers), where no change should be made to ownership counts.

- **Consistency in Related Functions**: Related functions have consistent annotations, ensuring transfer methods (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`) behave as outlined by the standard when comparing current and old states.

These annotations are structured to meet the requirements defined by ERC-721 while taking into consideration the necessary conditions for correctness and security as enforced through formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:54:11] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **Ownership and Balance Tracking**: The postconditions ensure `_ownedTokensCount` is updated correctly during transfers and maintain state consistency when the sender and receiver are the same (self-transfer).

- **Approval and Ownership Verification**: The `approve` function ensures a designated address is set as the approved controller for a specific NFT. The `getApproved` function verifies the return value matches the `_tokenApprovals`.

- **Approval Tracking**: The `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` methods verify and ensure that the `operatorApprovals` mapping accurately reflects the state.

These annotations ensure the contract operates according to the ERC-721 standard, highlighting the state-changing effects of each method. These formal specifications help verify correctness within the operations of this non-fungible token standard.

### Key Component Explanation:

- **Balance and Ownership**: Functions like `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` check that they correctly reflect the state mappings `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner`.

- **Approval Management**: The `approve` and `getApproved` functions ensure that approval states are accurately set and verified, reflecting the `_tokenApprovals` mappings.

- **Transfer Functions**: 
  - The `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions ensure that the sender is authorized (either owner, approved address, or operator).
  - Ownership transfer postconditions accurately adjust `_ownedTokensCount` for the `_from` and `_to` addresses, except in self-transfer cases where no balance update occurs.

- **Operator Checks**: 
  - The `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` functions maintain correct and consistent mapping states for `_operatorApprovals`.

These formal specifications serve to accurately describe the expected state transitions and conditions that must hold true for the contract's operations per ERC-721 standards.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:55:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **Balance and Ownership Verification**: The `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` functions verify that they are consistent with the state variables `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner`.

- **Approval and Authorization**: The `approve` function verifies that the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator before setting approvals. Similarly, `getApproved` verifies that the return shows the correct approved address.

- **Transfer Verification**: Transfer functions (`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`) confirm authorized execution by verifying sender identity and modifying affected account balances accordingly. They also ensure that self-transfers keep balance changes intact.

- **Operator Management**: The operator functions (`setApprovalForAll`, `isApprovedForAll`) guarantee that all approvals are accurately reflected in the `_operatorApprovals` state mapping.

These annotations ensure functionality consistent with expected behavior, complying with ERC-721 standards while providing robust state integrity across operations.
