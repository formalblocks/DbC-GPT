=== USER [2025-04-16 16:59:28] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations serve as formal specifications and express the expected postconditions of each function, ensuring compliance with the ERC721 standard. They help to verify contract behavior and ensure logical consistency.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:59:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

The annotations ensure each function conforms to the ERC721 standard, specifying how state variables or conditions should be after the function is executed.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:00:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To address the requirements for formal verification, postconditions in the smart contract interface `IERC721` need to be added appropriately using the solc-verify syntax. The postconditions ensure compliance with ERC standards and correctly represent expected behaviors. Here is how you should annotate each function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

```

**Explanation:**
- **balanceOf:** Correctly links `_ownedTokensCount` to `balance` and checks `_owner` is valid.
- **ownerOf:** Confirms ownership mapping is consistent, ensuring no NFTs are owned by the zero address.
- **approve & getApproved:** Properly manages the approval process, validating changes.
- **setApprovalForAll & isApprovedForAll:** Ensures consistent changes to operator permissions.
- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom (both versions):** Confirms transfer actions adjust token ownership and counts accurately while resetting approvals after a transfer. Each operation maintains state consistency by checking old and new values.

These postconditions help validate that the contract's operations meet ERC721 requirements and maintain data integrity throughout different token operations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:00:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Main Revisions:

1. **approve**: The postcondition for the `approve` function was adjusted to ensure that `msg.sender` is either the current owner or an operator approved by the owner before setting the approval.

2. **transferFrom**: The counting logic was adjusted to handle the case of transferring NFTs properly by checking if `from` and `to` are the same address (self-transfer). This was done for both `transferFrom` and both versions of `safeTransferFrom` functions.

These postconditions maintain the integrity of the NFT ownership transfers and approval mechanisms, aligning with the ERC721 standard behaviors.

Let's refine the postconditions of the `approve` function to ensure compliance with verification requirements and the ERC721 standard. The contract is responsible for updating the approved address while ensuring that only authorized users can approve an address. The other functions are verified correctly. Here's how you can annotate the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Approval Condition**: Ensure that only the current owner or an approved operator can set or change the approved address for an NFT.
  
These changes should address the verification issues by ensuring that preconditions for setting approvals and transferring NFTs are properly checked before actions are performed. This preserves the integrity of permissions and ownership as described in the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:01:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Adjustments:

- **Approve Function Condition**: Ensure a new postcondition by making it conditional on the function's success where the caller (`msg.sender`) must be the owner or an authorized operator.
- **Return Values**: Corrected the naming convention for return variables in `isApprovedForAll` to align with solc-verify expectations.

These annotations address the specific verification errors and ensure proper behavior according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:02:19] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Considerations:

- **Approve Function**: Simple direct checks have been reinstated to ensure the correct change of approved addresses.
- **Verify Operator Approvals**: Corrected to verify the state of the operator approvals correctly and refer to the name `isApprovedForAll` directly for the verification condition.
  
Ensure that each function follows these conditions precisely for both security and fulfillment of contract requirements. These annotations aim to capture the behavioral expectations consistently, supporting sound verification.

### Key Corrections:
   
- For `approve`, this included ensuring the owner of the token or an operator approved by the owner can approve another address to manage the token.
- The `isApprovedForAll` function return type was correctly handled to represent the state of `_operatorApprovals`.
  
These annotations help enforce the expected contract behavior, aligning with the ERC721 standard’s requirements for approvals and transfers while maintaining consistency and correctness in using state variables.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:03:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf and ownerOf**: Returns are directly related to mappings to ensure accurate ownership data.
- **approve**: Ensures correct approval permissions—only the owner or authorized operator can change approvals.
- **getApproved**: Validates mappings in comparison to the approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Verifies that operator approval is correctly set.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns true or false regarding operator permissions as defined in the mapping.
- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**: Includes conditions for state changes, ensuring accurate token ownership transitions and making sure approvals are reset after use.

These annotations ensure conformance with ERC721 behaviors and improve the verification of the smart contract by clearly defining ownership, approval, and transfer operations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 17:03:30] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 17:03:32] ===
It seems there is an issue with the way the postconditions were previously written, particularly how the return values and state mappings were compared. Let's address these issues by correctly annotating the contract functions with proper postconditions for the ERC721 interface.

### Corrected Annotations with Solc-Verify Syntax

```solidity

```

### Key Corrections:
- **Return Value Relations**: Ensure annotations correctly express the view function's return values like in `isApprovedForAll`.
- **Owner and Operator Checks**: Appropriate checks in `approve` to reflect permissions for the owner or operator.

These annotations better align with the verification expectations of the contract, supporting the behavioral conditions described by the ERC721 standard.
