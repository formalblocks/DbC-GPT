    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

The postconditions have been added to each function in accordance with the standard behaviors outlined by the ERC-721 specification. They ensure state changes related to token ownership, approval status, and transfer balances are correctly and logically represented.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:31:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Annotations Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the returned balance equals the number of tokens the owner account is recorded to own (`_ownedTokensCount`).
- **ownerOf**: Links the token ID to its current owner, ensuring it cannot be the zero address, which is invalid for ownership.
- **approve**: Updates the `_tokenApprovals` mapping such that the approved address for a token ID is correctly set.
- **getApproved**: Ensures the correct approved address for a token ID corresponds to what is stored in `_tokenApprovals`.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Toggles operator status correctly in `_operatorApprovals` for message sender.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Checks accurately if an operator is approved to manage all tokens of an owner from `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom** & **safeTransferFrom**: Postconditions ensure that ownership and balances are updated accurately after a transfer, respecting edge cases where sender equals recipient.

Specific state change tracking through `__verifier_old_uint` is used to track balances before the function call, ensuring accurate post-transfer state verification, which aligns with standard ERC-721 behavior.

**Key Annotations Details:**
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the result directly reflects the balance recorded in `_ownedTokensCount` for the given owner.
  
- **ownerOf**: Returns the owner from `_tokenOwner` for the specified `_tokenId`, ensuring that it’s a valid owner (not zero address).
  
- **approve**: Updates the `_tokenApprovals` mapping to reflect the new approved address for `_tokenId`.

- **getApproved**: Reflects the mapping `_tokenApprovals` for the given `_tokenId`, ensuring it's a valid NFT.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the `_operatorApprovals` to reflect that the operator's status is toggled as requested.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the approval status from `_operatorApprovals` directly for the query.

- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**: Ensure that the token transfer correctly updates the counts and assigns the new owner, considering the special case where the sender is transferring to themselves. These checks maintain the ERC-721 contract's behavioral consistency in both normal and safe transfers, with additional checks for contract receiver capability in `safeTransferFrom`.

This annotated interface adopts best practices for representing formal verification in Solidity while adhering to the ERC-721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:32:30] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Modifications:

- Adjusted `isApprovedForAll` postcondition to correctly return a boolean from the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

- Postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions include handling self-transfers where the sender and recipient are the same. They verify the transfer logic where ownership and balances change accordingly, relying on verification annotations (`__verifier_old_uint`) to track state before the function execution.

These changes ensure that all necessary behaviors of the ERC-721 standard regarding token ownership, approvals, and balance modifications are verified and annotated appropriately.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of the Annotations:

- **balanceOf**: Asserts that the returned balance corresponds to the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_owner`.

- **ownerOf**: Successfully retrieves the owner of a given `_tokenId`. The postcondition ensures that the `_owner` cannot be the zero address because NFTs assigned to address zero are invalid.

- **approve**: Confirms that the new approved address for `_tokenId` is accurately set in the `_tokenApprovals` mapping.

- **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address accurately reflects the state of the `_tokenApprovals` mapping for `_tokenId`. It also checks that the `_tokenId` is valid with a non-zero owner.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Verifies that the approval status for an operator over all tokens of the calling address (`msg.sender`) is successfully set in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the function returns whether the operator is authorized based on `_operatorApprovals`.

- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**: Includes conditions to confirm that token ownership and balances are correctly reflected post-transfer. For self-transfers, the conditions are adjusted such that account balances remain unchanged. The postconditions also reflect the fact that token ownership changes hands, assuming all checks (valid ownership, approved operator) are satisfied.

These annotations will help verify the correctness of the contract's intended behaviors, ensuring the functions uphold the ERC-721 standards.

### Annotations Explanation

- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance is equal to the count of tokens the owner account is recorded to possess.

- **ownerOf**: Confirms that the owner of a given token ID is correctly returned and it is a valid owner (not equal to zero address).

- **approve**: Assures that the new approved address for the specified token ID is correctly set in the `_tokenApprovals`.

- **getApproved**: Verifies the mapping reflects the approved address for a given token ID, ensuring the `_tokenId` is a valid NFT (has a valid owner).

- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator’s approval status is set in the `_operatorApprovals` for the caller.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns whether the operator is authorized to manage all tokens owned by the user.

- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**: Ensure that a transfer results in the token being owned by `_to` instead of `_from`, and the respective balances are updated; allows for self-transfers to maintain balance equivalence.

These annotations align the contract behavior with the standard practices of ERC-721 as described in the guidelines.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:34:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Notes

- **balanceOf**: Validates that the returned count corresponds to the balance stored in `_ownedTokensCount` for the provided `_owner`.

- **ownerOf**: Ensures the return is accurate per `_tokenOwner`, with the additional check that the owner is not a zero address.

- **approve**: Ensures the `_tokenApprovals` mapping is updated to reflect the approved address for the specific `_tokenId`.

- **getApproved**: Verifies the return of the correct approved address, with an additional check that `_tokenId` is associated with a data entry.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures the approval status for an operator for all tokens of the sender is correctly updated in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms the return value represents whether `_operator` is approved to manage all of `_owner`'s tokens.

- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**: Ensure that ownership is transferred correctly, with adjustments in the balance for both `_from` and `_to`. Specifically tracks the cases of a valid transfer versus a self-transfer where `_from == _to`.

This version complies with ERC-721 behaviors and the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:34:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Postcondition ensures the balance reported is equal to the number of tokens listed in `_ownedTokensCount` for the owner.

- **ownerOf**: Postcondition states that the function will return the owner of the given NFT if it exists (_tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)).

- **approve**: Updates the mapping of `_tokenApprovals` to set the approved address for a token.

- **getApproved**: Ensures the queried NFT's approved address matches that stored in `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets boolean approval for an operator over all of the caller’s tokens, reflected in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns true or false based on whether an operator is an approved manager for a given owner's token as stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: The postconditions verify that ownership (`_tokenOwner`) and token counts (`_ownedTokensCount`) are correctly managed before and after the function call. The conditions handle cases of typical transfers as well as self-transfers where `_from` equals `_to`.

These annotations ensure that the operations correctly obey the conditions described by the ERC-721 standard across different functions, particularizing the code to show invariant enforcement before and after each function call.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the function's return value mirrors the stored `_ownedTokensCount` for a given `_owner`.

- **ownerOf**: Confirms that the address returned as the owner for `_tokenId` is correct and not the zero address, ensuring the token is valid.

- **approve**: Postcondition verifies that the specified `_tokenId` has been updated in `_tokenApprovals` to reflect the new `_approved` address.

- **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address is what is stored in `_tokenApprovals` for the specified `_tokenId`, and the NFT is valid.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the `_operatorApprovals` to reflect that `_operator` is authorized or deauthorized for all tokens of `msg.sender`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns a boolean indicating whether `_operator` is authorized to manage all of `_owner`'s tokens, as stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Handle transfers by ensuring the `_to` owns the token after the transaction, balances update correctly, and self-transfers leave balances unaffected.

These annotations act as a formal verification mechanism to ensure that the contract's functions perform as expected, reflecting the correct state transitions of an ERC-721 token per the standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 16:35:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Asserts that the return value correctly reflects the count of tokens owned, per `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Ensures that the function returns the correct owner for a given `_tokenId`, verifying the NFT is valid (i.e., has a non-zero address owner).

- **approve**: Shows that `_tokenApprovals` for the specific `_tokenId` correctly records the new `_approved` address.

- **getApproved**: Ensures that the returned approved address matches the stored value in `_tokenApprovals` and that the token is properly owned.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that setting an operator is correctly updated in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Relates the return value to `_operatorApprovals` to reflect whether the operator is authorized.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Consider both normal and self-transfers, asserting that the recipient's (`_to`) and sender's (`_from`) balances are correctly updated, and ownership of the token is reassigned.

These annotations provide conditions that verify and enforce expected behaviors per the ERC-721 standard.
