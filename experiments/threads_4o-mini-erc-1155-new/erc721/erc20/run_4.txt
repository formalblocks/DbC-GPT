    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

- `balanceOf`: Postcondition ensures the balance of an owner is derived from `_ownedTokensCount`.
- `ownerOf`: Postcondition confirms the returned owner is exactly the owner mapped to the `_tokenId`.
- `approve`: Ensures that the `_approved` address is set for the `_tokenId` if the caller is the owner or an approved operator.
- `getApproved`: Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored value.
- `setApprovalForAll`: Matches the state of operator approval for all tokens.
- `isApprovedForAll`: Ensures return value reflects the approval state of an operator for a given owner.
- `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`: Postconditions relate to ownership transfer changes, ensuring the caller is authorized, modifying ownership states, and ensuring that the sender and receiver updates are consistent with transfers.

Let's correct the postconditions based on the feedback from your compiler and the required functionalities described in the ERC-721 standard. Here's how the postconditions can be added to the smart contract interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

        * @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender]) || !success
    */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == approved
    */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool approved);

    /**

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;

```

### Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures the balance returned matches the owned token count for the owner.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms the owner address for the given token ID matches the mapping.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Updates approved address for the token and validates function caller's authority.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Returns the approved address for a given token, linked to the state variable.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Changes the approval status for all assets of the message sender, confirming the status.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Checks and returns if the operator is approved for all tokens of the owner.

7. **`transferFrom`** and **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensure token ownership is transferred, token counts are updated correctly, and all authority checks are respected. Approvals are reset after transfers, maintaining correct balances when transferring tokens, validating sender's authority (owner, operator, or approval).

These annotations should meet the ERC-721 standard's requirements and resolve the verification errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:48:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

Each function is annotated with the correct conditions, which are crucial to passing the verification process and ensuring the contract behaves according to the ERC-721 standard:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The balance returned should match the count of owned tokens for the given owner.
2. **`ownerOf`**: The return value should equal the owner mapped for the particular token ID.
3. **`approve`**: Conditions ensure setting the approved address only if the caller is the owner or authorized operator.
4. **`getApproved`**: Directly reflects the stored approved address for a given token.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Sets operator approvals and confirms state change.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms if the operator is approved for the owner.
7. **`transferFrom`** and **`safeTransferFrom`** functions handle ownership transfer, ensuring balances are updated correctly, approvals are cleared appropriately, and authority is checked.

Additional logical errors, such as ensuring return values correctly represent updated or existing contracts' state, have been rectified. The functions are now consistently marked with postconditions that respect the prior state and allow for expected transitions within the contract data.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:49:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 13:49:39] ===
To address the issues and ensure that postconditions for the `IERC721` interface are properly verified, it's crucial to have appropriate and comprehensive postconditions representing expected behavior accurately based on the ERC-721 standard. Some of your current errors indicate that certain conditions may not hold. Let’s refine them to reflect the specified abstract contract operations.

Below is the corrected version with all functions annotated:

    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Changes and Explanations:

- **Self-Transfer Handling:** Added conditions to manage self-transfers (`msg.sender == _to`) effectively in postconditions like for the function `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`. It prevents decrementing ownership count when the `_from` and `_to` addresses are the same.

- **Transfer Authorization Check:** Postconditions reflect who can authoritatively transfer NFT: owner, approved operator, or directly approved address.

These improvements should address the rendered errors and align the functions closely with the intended behavior of the ERC-721 standard. Ensure that the functions strictly follow function signatures and logical invariances to prevent any pre/postcondition mismatch during implementation.

To resolve the verification errors and ensure the postconditions accurately reflect both the state changes and the assumptions of the contract, we need to clarify how the function modifies the state according to ERC-721 standards. We'll address the potential logical inconsistencies in the transfer functions that cause verification failures.

### Key Enhancements:

- **Safeguard Empty Balance Transfer:** Added a condition in the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions to ensure that only tokens with non-zero balances are being transferred.

- **Ownership Assurances and Approvals:** Confirmed ownership changes and reset approvals on every transfer, consistent with ERC-721 standards.

- **Operator and Approval Checks:** Ensure verification of proper authorization before any transfer actions are permitted.

These modifications address the primary issues and fulfill the correctness requirements envisaged by the ERC-721 standard. By ensuring that `_ownedTokensCount[_from] > 0` before decrementing, we prevent erroneous operations. The annotations strictly follow logical expectations for transfers, operator permissions, and approved addresses management.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 13:50:40] ===
To ensure that the postconditions in the `IERC721` contract interface are accurately articulated according to ERC-721 standards, let's focus on the conditions for transfer functions, especially handling the case when a token is successfully transferred. The persistent issue seems to be with the decrement of the `_ownedTokensCount` and ensuring valid authorization.

Here’s an adjusted version that addresses these issues:

```solidity

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition _owner == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /// @notice postcondition (_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved && (msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender])) || (_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] != _approved)
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool approved);

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender )

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to

    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == (msg.sender == _to ? __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) : __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1)
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_from] == (msg.sender == _to ? __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) : __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1)

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Ownership Check and Transfer Logic:**
  - Ensure the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions only permit valid owners or approved individuals to make a transfer.
  - Adjusted postconditions to handle the case where `_from` and `_to` are the same (self-transfer logic), thereby ensuring that no erroneous balance update takes place.

- **Approvals Reset:** 
  - Ensures that upon successful transfers, the approval for the `_tokenId` is reset.

These annotated postconditions aim to encapsulate all necessary state changes and operational constraints expected of each method according to the ERC-721 standard, providing both safety and clarity in the contract's intended functionality.

To resolve the verification errors and ensure the postconditions in the IERC721 contract interface are aligned with the ERC-721 standard, let's refine the functions, focusing on correctly managing authorization checks and maintaining consistency in ownership changes. Here’s how you can improve the annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition _owner == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /// @notice postcondition (_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved && (msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender])) || (_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] != _approved)
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == isApprovedForAll
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);

    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) ==> (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1)
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) ==> (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1)
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Authorization Check:**
   - Ensure that the person initiating a transfer is the owner, has operator approval, or is explicitly approved.

2. **Ownership Transfer:**
   - Write postconditions accounting for the changes in ownership and approval. 
   - Avoid decrementing the balance for self-transfers by including `_from != _to` in the condition.

3. **Approval Reset:**
   - Confirm that once a transfer occurs, the approval of the token resets to the zero address.

By refining the postconditions to handle all necessary checks and transitions, we align with the ERC-721 specifications, providing accuracy and reliability in token operations.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the parsing errors and ensure that the postconditions for the ERC721 smart contract are properly annotated and verified, we must adjust the way logical expressions are constructed. 

Let's correct the syntax and logic below:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition _owner == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /// @notice postcondition (_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved) && (msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender])
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool operatorApproved);

    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Logical Conditions:** We ensure that logical operations are correctly expressed, particularly using the conditional operator `(condition ? true_case : false_case)` to handle different scenarios like self-transfers.

- **Authorization Checks:** The conditions for transfers verify that the sender has the authority required for the operation. We verify if the `msg.sender` is either the owner or approved entity.

- **Ownership Transfers:** The annotations account for decrementing the balance of `_from` and incrementing the balance for `_to` only if `_from` and `_to` are different. 

- **Approval Reset:** Successfully include the reset condition for approvals, making sure each transfer operation clears any existing approval for the current token.

This solution ensures proper syntax and logic for tests, improving clarity and the contract's adherence to expected behavior per ERC-721 standards.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 13:51:57] ===
Let's refine the annotations using proper identifiers and correct logic according to the ERC-721 standard. The identifier `operatorApproved` should match the return type of the function `isApprovedForAll`. Let's use the return value appropriately. Here's the updated contract interface with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {
    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

     */
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /**
     * @notice postcondition (_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved && (msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender])) || (_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] != _approved)
     */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
     * @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
     */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
     */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == result
     */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool result);

    /**

     */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Corrected Return Identifier:**
   - The return value of `isApprovedForAll` is set as `result` to avoid undefined identifiers.

2. **Postconditions for Transfers:**
   - Ensures postconditions check for valid authorization before ownership transfer, reset approvals post-transfer, and adjust balances accounting only for transfers to different owners to handle self-transfer cases correctly.

3. **Consistency:**
   - Maintained consistent logic and expressions for access control and balance adjustments, adhering closely to the specified standard.

These annotations ensure the contract functions align properly with ERC-721 expectations and logical data transition mappings without triggering verification errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:52:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 13:52:18] ===
The issue you’re encountering is related to the use of an undefined identifier within your specifications. When writing postconditions for the `isApprovedForAll` function, the return value should be connected explicitly to the state. Here's how you can annotate the provided interface with correct postconditions based on the given requirements:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

     */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
     * @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
     */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
     */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == isApprovedForAll
     */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);

     */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Postconditions for `isApprovedForAll`:** Correct the postcondition to check that the result of `isApprovedForAll` matches the operator approval status from `_operatorApprovals`.

- **Transfer Logic:** Implement checks for successful ownership transfer reflecting in `_ownedTokensCount` and appropriate handling for self-transfers, ensuring no decrement occurs in the owner's balance when `_from` equals `_to`.

This refines all functions to verify contract state transitions accurately and in alignment with the ERC-721 specification.
