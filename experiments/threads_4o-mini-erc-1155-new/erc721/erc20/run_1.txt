=== USER [2025-04-16 13:36:18] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These specifications ensure the contract adheres to the expected behaviors of ERC-721, handling NFT ownership, transfer, approval, and operator settings effectively.

To address your task of specifying formal verification postconditions for the `IERC721` contract, I've outlined annotations for each function. These annotations are based on the ERC-721 standard behavior for non-fungible tokens.

```solidity

These annotations capture essential behaviors of an ERC-721 token interface, ensuring verification conditions for balance, ownership, approvals, role management, and transfers as per the standard's requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:37:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** Checks that the `_owner` is valid and ties the function return to the state variable.
- **ownerOf:** Ensures ownership is valid and ties the result to the mapping.
- **approve:** Updates or confirms the approved address for an NFT.
- **getApproved:** Returns the approved address from the state mapping.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Set or revoke operator approval for all tokens under the owner.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Ensures the queried approval is reflected in the state.
- **transferFrom and safeTransfers:** Handles the transfer of ownership by updating counters and validating ownership while allowing operator approvals.

These annotations thoroughly capture the required properties of an ERC-721 contract according to the standard. They ensure that any changes to the contract's state are as expected, covering the roles of ownership, approval, and transfer logic.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** Ensures that `_owner` is not the zero address and that the returned balance matches the `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf:** Verifies the returned `_owner` is the mapped owner in `_tokenOwner` and is not the zero address.
- **approve:** Sets `_tokenApprovals` for `_tokenId` to `_approved`. It verifies that `_approved` is either zero, or the caller is authorized.
- **getApproved:** Returns the approved address for the given `_tokenId` as mapped in `_tokenApprovals`.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Updates `_operatorApprovals` map with the current status.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Confirms the queried approval status.
- **transferFrom:** Ensures ownership is correctly transferred and appropriately handles operatory approvals. The `_from` owner token count decreases while the `_to` owner receives one.
- **safeTransferFrom (overloaded):** Similar behavior to `transferFrom`, validated by state transitions ensuring the integrity of transfers.

These annotations ensure compliance with ERC-721 requirements, encapsulating balance, ownership, approval, and transfer functionalities with formal verifications.

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** Ensures that the `_owner` is not a zero address and the balance reflects the `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf:** Confirms that the `_owner` matches the `_tokenOwner` mapping and is not zero.
- **approve:** Annotates changes in `_tokenApprovals`, accounting for zero address and authorized operations.
- **getApproved:** Ties the return to the `_tokenApprovals` mapping.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Sets or revokes operator status and reflects this in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Examines operator status for consistency.
- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom (overloaded):** Handle token movement, update ownership, and account adjustments with proper authorization checks. They also manage specific conditions for self-transfers properly.

These annotations uphold the ERC-721 standard's core expectations: ownership tracking, approval management, and secure transfer mechanics.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:38:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 13:38:36] ===
To resolve the errors and add proper `solc-verify` postconditions for the `IERC721` contract, it's key to ensure that the expressions are correctly formulated. Each postcondition must consider the consistency of state changes according to the contract's logic and typical ERC-721 behavior.

Here's how to do it by addressing each function appropriately:

```solidity

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:_** Ensures that the `_owner` is a valid address and the balance returned matches the `_ownedTokensCount` for that owner.
- **ownerOf:** Confirms the returned `_owner` matches the mapping and is a valid non-zero address owner.
- **approve:** Updates `_tokenApprovals` as long as the caller is authorized.
- **getApproved:** Returns the current approval status from `_tokenApprovals`.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Changes approval status for an operator managing all assets of the msg.sender.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Confirms the resultant operator status.
- **transferFrom and Transfers:** Handles the transfer of ownership within the constraints of authorization (owner, operator) and updates ownership mappings. Specifically handles no-effect in self-transfers by ensuring no net change in balance.

These annotations carefully ensure that each function adheres to standard ERC-721 behavior while addressing the formal verification process, capturing both logical and computational behavior correctly.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:39:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation for the Annotations:
- **balanceOf:** Checks that `_owner` is a non-zero address and reflects accurately in `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf:** Confirms ownership query matches the mapping and is non-zero when returned.
- **approve:** Updates `_tokenApprovals` correctly based on the authorization, with zero address as a condition or maintaining the old state.
- **getApproved:** Confirms the return value matches `_tokenApprovals`.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Sets the `_operatorApprovals` mapping to the new state matching the `_approved` flag.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Returns the approval status, ensuring it's consistent with `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom and Transfers:** Validates ownership change and account balances accurately, handling both regular and self-transfers securely.

These annotations serve to ensure the formal verification process of the ERC-721 behaviors, capturing the logical integrity of decisions and state changes in the contract.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:39:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Key Changes and Notes:
- **`approve`:** Removed inappropriate use of `__verifier_old_uint` as it was being matched against an address. Simplified logic with logical OR to reflect cases where the state should not change.
- **View functions:** Directly map the return to the state, ensuring the mapping is clear and logical consistent with the contract state.
- **Transfer functions:** Correct handling for both regular and self-transfers, ensuring logical checks complement operation mappings.
- **Operator approval:** Handles the logic correctly by ensuring consistency upon `setApproval` and `isApprovedForAll`.

By following verification guidelines precisely, this modification resolves type mismatches, logical errors, and ensures functional validation and correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:40:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** Validates that `_owner` is not a zero address and the return value matches the mapping `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf:** Guarantees that `_owner` is the owner of the `_tokenId` and is a non-zero address.
- **approve:** Ensures the `_approved` address is set for `_tokenId` only if the caller is the owner or an authorized operator.
- **getApproved:** The return of the function is verified to be the address stored for that token in `_tokenApprovals`.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Confirms the `_operator` approval status is updated as `_approved`.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Checks that the result accurately reflects the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom:** Checks correct ownership transfer, handling for same origin and destination (_from == _to) and ensures the caller is authorized either via ownership or approval.

The annotations adhere to the ERC-721 standard, managing both token ownership and operator approvals, ensuring that all functions maintain state consistency.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:40:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** Ensures `_owner` is not the zero address and returns the count from `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf:** Validates the `_owner` for `_tokenId` matches `_tokenOwner` and is not zero.
- **approve:** Checks that the `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` matches `_approved` only if the sender is the owner or operator.
- **getApproved:** Directly ties the function output to `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Reflects changes in approval status for `_operator` of `msg.sender`.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Ensures output reflects the mapping `_operatorApprovals`.
- **Transfers (transferFrom/safeTransferFrom):** 
  - Properly updates ownership.
  - Adjusts counts except when `_from` is the same as `_to` (self-transfer).
  - Requires correct authority for executing transfer, whether via direct ownership, operator rights, or explicit approval.

These specifications assure compliance with the contract's expected functional output while adhering to ERC-721 standards, providing a transparent and verifiable model of state transitions and ownership logic.
