=== USER [2025-04-16 13:52:36] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations are based on the expected behavior of ERC721 functions, describing the states before and after executing each function. The usage of postconditions helps in verifying that the contracts uphold the expected behavior as per the ERC721 standard. Each function is accompanied by conditions describing the changes to relevant mappings and variables.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:53:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

```

In these annotations, the postconditions describe the expected changes after function execution. For instance, when an NFT is transferred, the owner's token count should be adjusted, the owner of the token should change, and any existing approval is reset. These reflect the operations and compliance with the ERC-721 standard. The syntax `(__verifier_old_uint(...))` is used to reference previous state values for verification purposes.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:54:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

The annotations now ensure that the conditions match correctly such as checking ownership, approvals, and state transitions. This includes keeping track of the previous state using `__verifier_old_uint` for the counters to ensure correctness in state changes, particularly focusing on mappings related to `owner`, `approvals`, and `owned token counts`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:54:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

In these adjustments, functions that return values directly refer to the relevant state variables. The postconditions ensure consistency across related functions, especially where state changes like ownership transfer and approval status reset occur. Adjustments to identifiers such as `approved` are made to align with expected function returns directly mapped to corresponding state mappings.

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Type Consistency**: Ensure all postconditions match the expected data types. This avoids errors like trying to equate types directly without a mapping of expected types.
2. **Verification Annotations**: Use proper mappings for state changes concerning state and ownership updates.
3. **Operator Check**: Properly handled using the `_operatorApprovals` mapping without direct conditional logic which causes type mismatch.

### Verification Logic Explanation:
- **balanceOf** and **ownerOf** only read state variables, so the postconditions verify these directly relate to returned values.
- **approve**: Verifies changes in approval can only be set if the sender is the owner or an approved operator.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Simply returns the operator status and the condition reflects this mapping retrieval.
- **Transfer functions** (transferFrom, safeTransferFrom): Ensure state changes occur only if valid conditions are met, including ownership change and resetting approvals.

These changes align with the required smart contract state changes per ERC721, ensuring integrity in ownership transitions and permissions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:55:30] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes and Explanations:
- **balanceOf** and **ownerOf**: Directly relate return values to appropriate state variables.
- **approve**: The success of setting the approval is contingent on the caller being the owner or an authorized operator. The postcondition reflects this logical connection.
- **setApprovalForAll** and **isApprovedForAll**: Directly relate the result or state change to state mappings.
- **Transfer functions**: Verify appropriate transfer of ownership and update of owner balances on successful transfer, with token approval reset. All conditional logic ensures `_from` and `_to` are not the zero address and references previous states using `__verifier_old_uint`.

These annotations mirror the compliance requirement outlined in the Ethereum ERC721 standard, protecting against erroneous changes while preserving the logical flow of state alterations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:56:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata data) external;

```

### Summary of Corrections:
- **balanceOf** and **ownerOf** postconditions are straightforward and directly relate the return value to state variables.
- **approve** postcondition now checks if the caller is the owner or an operator and sets the approval.
- **setApprovalForAll** and **isApprovedForAll** postconditions correctly identify mapping states to return values.
- **Transfer functions** ensure state changes including resetting approvals and transferring ownership are reflected accurately in postconditions.

These corrections ensure compliance with the specification, ensuring the contract reflects safe and expected changes to state variables during operation, as expected in ERC-721 standard implementations.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points in the Changes:
1. **Handling `transferFrom` Postconditions**:
   - **Conditional Adjustments**: Added conditions to account for the caller being the owner or an authorized operator.
   - **Ownership Transfers**: Adjust token counts based on immediate prior state checks.

2. **Consistency**:
   - Ensured `__verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from])` is adjusted only when relevant functions execute correctly.
   - Ensured mappings reflect consistency in postconditions conforming to ERC-721 specifications.

These improvements cater for self-transfers and verify that changes remain compliant, reliably capturing changes in the ownership, approvals, and counts.

To correct the verification conditions in the ERC721 contract and ensure compliance with formal verification standards, we'll need to solve the type compatibility and properly define logical conditions in postcondition verification. Here is how the postconditions can be defined and corrected:

```solidity

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

```

### Key Highlights of the Updated Postconditions:

1. **Owner and Approval Verification**: 
   - Ensure ownership and permission settings are correctly validated for both direct transfers and setting approvals.

2. **Transfer and Transaction Integrity**:
   - Verifies correct decrement/increment of token counts during transfers.
   - Ensures correct ownership assignment after the transfer.

3. **Historic Value Reference**:
   - Using `__verifier_old_uint` appropriately to reflect the state before change.

4. **Approval Reset Handling**:
   - Resetting any applicable approvals upon successful transfer to prevent unauthorized control.

This setup helps maintain contract logic consistency and aims at satisfying formal verification while following the ERC-721 standard.
