=== USER [2025-04-16 14:04:49] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:05:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Notes:**
- The postconditions assume no action is taken by malicious actors or other unintended effects.
- The handling of exceptions (e.g., when `_to` is a contract) is left out but could be detailed further if needed.
- The transfer and approval methods must ensure that all conditions are consistent with the ERC specifications, especially ownership and approval criteria.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:06:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Notes:

- **Postconditions:** Postconditions are selected to assert state changes in terms of ownership transfers, approvals, and operator approvals, as specified in the ERC-721 standard.

- **Balance and Owner Queries:** The preconditions ensure that neither querying the balance of the zero address nor the owner of an invalid token occurs, as these would throw exceptions.

- **Transfers and Approvals:** Postconditions related to transferring ownership respect the rules of approval and revocation during ownership transfer.

- **Usage Consistency:** Variables and state mappings are strictly referred to as declared; no shorthand or aliasing is used, maintaining alignment with guidelines.

This implementation focuses on logical verification through postconditions instead of covering actual Solidity runtime exceptions (such as detecting zero addresses), which the original contract logic typically handles.

        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points

1. **balanceOf:** Ensures that `_owner` is not the zero address (which would be invalid) and that the return value equals the count of tokens owned by `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf:** Confirms that the owner of the token `_tokenId` is indeed `_owner`, who must not be the zero address as NFTs cannot be assigned to the zero address.

3. **approve:** Asserts that `_approved` is the new approved address for the `_tokenId`.

4. **getApproved:** Ensures the function returns the correct approved address for `_tokenId`.

5. **setApprovalForAll:** Updates operator approval for the full control of the owner's NFTs.

6. **isApprovedForAll:** Returns whether an operator is approved to manage all of the owner's NFTs.

7. **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom:** These functions ensure the ownership transfer, updating token ownership, approval removal, and owner's token count is adjusted properly.

These postconditions ensure consistent function behaviors in line with the ERC-721 specification.

### Explanation:

- **Balance and Ownership Queries**: For functions `balanceOf` and `ownerOf`, postconditions verify that an owner and token holder exist and return consistent values with state variables related to token ownership.

- **Approval Management**: `approve` and `setApprovalForAll` confirm that authorization and revocation of control set the `_tokenApprovals` or `_operatorApprovals` mappings correctly.

- **Token Transfer**: The `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions include handling for transfers where `_from` equals `_to`, maintaining consistency without changing ownership records in such cases. Additionally, these functions clear approvals on successful ownership transfers.

These are representative annotations, not an exhaustive coverage of Solidity's potential runtime exceptions which are traditionally handled in the logic of smart contract implementations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:08:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

1. **Balance and Ownership**: 
    - `balanceOf`: Ensures the number of NFTs owned by `_owner` is consistent with `_ownedTokensCount`, and `_owner` is not the zero address.
    - `ownerOf`: Checks that the owner assigned to `_tokenId` is `_owner` and that `_owner` is not the zero address.
  
2. **Approval Management**:
    - `approve`: The `_approved` address is set to approve control of `_tokenId`, applicable when `msg.sender` owns the NFT or is an approved operator.
    - `getApproved`: Should return the current approved address, satisfying `_tokenApprovals` mapping.

3. **Operator Approval**:
    - `setApprovalForAll`: Sets the operator approval status correctly for all NFTs of the owner.
    - `isApprovedForAll`: The function checks if an operator is approved for all of the owner's NFTs.

4. **Transfers**:
    - `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`: Manage the ownership transfer, and handle edge cases such as self-transfers by correctly updating the `_ownedTokensCount` and clearing any token-level approvals after the transfer.

By using well-defined postconditions, these annotations ensure that the contract's state and function behavior are consistent with ERC-721 expectations. The contract's annotations focus on checking the validity and updating of ownership and approvals as per standard rules.

### Explanation:

Here, I've added the necessary postconditions based on the ERC721 standard:

1. **balanceOf**: Enforces that `_owner` should be valid and that it accurately reflects the `_ownedTokensCount` for that owner.
   
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the owner is set correctly and not assigned to the zero address.

3. **approve**: Requires the message sender to either be the token owner or authorized to manage approvals, correctly setting the `_tokenApprovals`.

4. **getApproved**: Checks that the function returns the correct approved address or the zero address if none.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures setting of operator status aligns with the desired approval state.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Tests whether an operator is registered as handling all of an owner's NFTs.

7. **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Confirms correct transfer handling, including balance updates and resetting of individual NFT approvals. These conditions also provide coverage for the authorization paths enabling transfers, such as direct ownership or operation rights.

These annotations ensure that the changes in function-specific state in the contract conform to ERC-721’s expectations, focusing on token ownership and approvals.

### Explanation

1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition checks that `_owner` is not the zero address and ensures the balance returned matches `_ownedTokensCount` for `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: Confirms that `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` returns `_owner` and `_owner` is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: Ensures that the caller must either own the token or be an authorized operator and sets `_tokenApprovals` correctly.

4. **getApproved**: Returns the approved address for `_tokenId`; postcondition matches this with `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Sets the status of the operator authorization correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms the status of operator authorization.

7. **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: 
   - Ensure the caller is authorized to transfer the token (as the owner, by approval, or as an operator).
   - Confirm that transfers update ownership and balance counts correctly, especially handling self-transfer gracefully.
   - Reset token approval following a successful transfer.

These annotations ensure that method effects such as ownership transfers, balance changes, and approval settings adhere to the ERC-721 standard, verifying the logical correctness of state changes within the contract.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:10:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf`:** These methods confirm that the owner addresses are non-zero and maintain correct balance/ownership records according to `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner`.

- **`approve` and `getApproved`:** These update and query the `_tokenApprovals` mapping to ensure only authorized entities can manage approvals.

- **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll`:** These methods ensure the operator approval status is set and checked correctly, manipulating the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

- **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`:** 
  - Properly handles token transfer ensuring only authorized entities can perform the transfer.
  - Updates `_tokenOwner` and `_ownedTokensCount` correctly, with special handling for self-transfers to preserve balances.
  - Clears any specific NFT approvals after transfer.

The use of these postconditions ensures the contract operates within the expected behaviors as defined by the ERC-721 standard.
