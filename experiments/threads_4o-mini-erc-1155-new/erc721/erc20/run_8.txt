    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf:** Checks that querying a non-zero address returns a balance consistent with state variables.
- **ownerOf:** Ensures the owner of the token ID is correctly retrieved from `_tokenOwner`.
- **approve:** Sets the approved address for the token and checks authorization conditions.
- **getApproved:** Retrieves the approved address for a token ID.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Updates the operator approval status for transaction management.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Confirms approval status for operators.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom:** Manages the ownership transfer updates, ensuring correct ownership and balances.

Each function maintains its integrity by verifying the relating state to expected conditions.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **balanceOf:** Corrected the condition to appropriately handle zero addresses.
- **approve:** Postcondition ensures `_approved` is set only by the owner or an approved operator.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom:** Adjusted conditions to more accurately reflect proper ownership validation prior to transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:12:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes:

- **balanceOf:** Specifies that `_owner` must not be the zero address and reflects the relationship between `_ownedTokensCount` and the balance.
- **ownerOf:** Requires the owner for a valid `_tokenId` to be non-zero.
- **approve:** Enforces the requirement that the caller must be the owner or an approved operator.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom:** Adds postconditions to reflect state updates dependent on the address changes, owner checks, and approver checks.

### Notes on Key Changes:

1. **approve:** Enhanced postconditions to clarify that only the owner or an authorized operator can call this function.

2. **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom Functions:**
    - The conditions for these functions now include a success return that accounts for failure scenarios and checks the conditions for ownership before the transfer.
    - Rephrased the postcondition for valid transfers, ensuring both the ownership change and balance updates are included only when the transfer is successful.

These changes align each function with the expected state transitions in an ERC-721 compliant implementation, focusing particularly on access control and state changes.

### Explanation

- **approve:** Indicates that an approved address change will only occur if the sender is the owner or an operator. Preservation of the ownership state is included as a postcondition as it should be unaffected.
  
- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom:** These functions ensure postconditions cover:
  - Ownership migration and its correctness.
  - Adjusting account balances with their tokens before and after state.
  - Clearing approvals post transfer.
  - Permission verification through either the owner or approved entities. 

The annotations consider address invariants (non-zero), balances, access control, and maintain the integrity of transfers as per ERC-721 specifications.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:13:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **approve:** This ensures that only the current owner or an authorized operator can call this function successfully.

- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom:**
  - Adjust for transfers including self-transfers, where the `_from` and `_to` addresses are identical.
  - Maintain token balance consistency over state transitions.
  - Ensure approvals are cleared on transfers.

The corrections should ensure more robust conditions for the transitions and access control enforced by the smart contract logic of ERC-721.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:14:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **approve:** Ensures postconditions check that either the owner or an approved operator can set an approval.

- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom:** Postconditions ensure:
  - Ownership transfer checks for equal `_from` and `_to` for self-transfers.
  - Correct balance decrement for `_from` and increment for `_to`, barring self-transfers.
  - Approval for `_tokenId` is cleared post-transfer.
  - Proper sender authorization checks via ownership, operator approvals, or token-specific approvals.

This structure should ensure the contract enforces both ERC-721 specifications and conditions specific to contract behavior, addressing self-transfers appropriately.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:15:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Key Changes

- **Formal Verification Conditions:** Updated postconditions to ensure they verify against the ERC-721 standard. This includes ownership check when approving tokens, state changes on transfer, and the authorization checks for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`.
  
- **Self-transfer Special Handling:** Addressed self-transfers by allowing cases where `_from == _to` to pass postconditions without necessarily altering internal state.

- **Consistency and Integrity:** All functions ensure they reflect state changes consistently, especially for token balances and approvals related to operations, adhering to the requirement to ensure ERC721 standard rules.

These updates aim to cover expectations and constraints as specified within the standard, aligning with both expected behavior and error handling scenarios that maintain the correct state transitions.

### Notable Adjustments:
- **approval and transfer authorization postconditions**: These adequately enforce access restrictions by checking ownership and operator status.
- **accuracy in transfers and ownership changes**: Handling self-transfers avoids undesired balance changes.
- **clarified return values**: Adjusted views and boolean evaluations should match state variable truth directly, ensuring no conceptual mismatch between expectation and actual verifier outcomes.

This version strictly adheres to verification rules using the provided constraints while maintaining ERC-721 compliance.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:16:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Key Adjustments:

1. **Postconditions for Balance and Ownership Queries:**
   - Ensure non-zero addresses are expected.
   - Tie return values directly to state variables for accurate reporting.

2. **Approve and Set Approval Authorization Contexts:**
   - Validate that the sender is authorized to approve by being the owner or operator.

3. **Transfer Functions:**
   - Clearly define the new ownership and adjust balances.
   - Handle self-transfers where `_from` equals `_to` without updating balances unnecessarily.
   - Reset all current approvals upon a successful transfer.
   - Ensure the sender has appropriated authority via different means.

These conditions form a consistent verification framework across ERC721 operations, maintaining correctness in both state changes and authorization control.
