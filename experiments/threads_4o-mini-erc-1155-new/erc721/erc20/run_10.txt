=== USER [2025-04-16 14:21:30] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points
- Each postcondition carefully ensures the captured state changes are reflected upon method execution per transaction (transfer, approved settings, etc.).
- In `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` methods, once the NFT transfer occurs, the ownership count is adjusted accordingly, the NFT owner is updated, and token approvals are reset.
- The `isApprovedForAll` method checks operator approval status between two addresses.
- Formal annotations using exact state variables and referencing previous states with `__verifier_old_uint()` are applied where necessary.


=== USER [2025-04-16 14:22:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Annotations:
- **Initialization Checks:** Each transfer function checks that the owner's balance changes correctly and token ownership transfers appropriately.
- **Self-transfer Handling:** Annotations account for self-transfers where `_from` equals `_to`.
- **Approval Resets:** After a transfer, approved addresses for the token are reset to address(0).
- **Operator Approvals:** The `isApprovedForAll` function reflects whether an operator is approved for all tokens of the owner according to `_operatorApprovals`.
- **Ownership Verification:** Each relevant function ensures the consistency of the owner of the NFT (`_tokenOwner`).

These annotations ensure correctness and adherence to the ERC-721 standard by explicitly covering the changes and invariants in state variables when the functions are called.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:22:43] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations:
- **Token Ownership Transfer:** The state of ` _tokenOwner[_tokenId]` should reflect that the new owner is `_to` after a transfer in the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` methods.
- **Balance Updates:** The NFT ownership count `_ownedTokensCount` should be updated appropriately, accounting for the transfer unless it's a self-transfer.
- **Approval Reset:** Any pre-existing approvals for that tokenId are cleared when ownership changes.
- **Operator Approval Check:** Ensures the operator approval mapping is queried correctly in `isApprovedForAll`.
- **BalanceQuery:** Reflects direct read of the balance for a given owner in `balanceOf`.
- **Ownership Verification:** Ensures the current ownership state is queried correctly in `ownerOf`.

These annotations ensure that functions' postconditions reflect the expected state changes from ERC-721 operations, focusing on correctness and completeness as per ERC standards.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Annotations:
- **Balance Queries:** The `balanceOf` method verifies the count of NFTs owned by `_owner`.
- **Ownership Queries:** The `ownerOf` method checks against `_tokenOwner`.
- **Approval Changes:** The `approve` method reflects setting a new approved address for an NFT.
- **Approval Retrieval:** The `getApproved` checks for the approved address for a token.
- **Operator Approvals:** The `setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` methods relate operator approvals.
- **Token Transfer:** In `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`, postconditions ensure `_tokenOwner` is updated, counts are adjusted, and approvals reset.
- **Special Handling for Self-Transfers:** Conditions accommodate self-transfer scenarios where `_from == _to`.

These annotations uphold the postconditions expected from executing functions against an ERC-721 compliant smart contract interface.

### Key Annotations:
- **Ownership Management:** The transfer functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`) ensure that the ownership, balance updates, and approval resets are accurately reflected.
- **Approval Mechanisms:** Functions `approve`, `getApproved`, and `setApprovalForAll` manage approval state changes effectively.
- **Operator Authorization:** Function `isApprovedForAll` checks and reflects the operator's authorized status for all tokens owned by an owner.
- **Self-transfers:** Postconditions handle cases where `_from` equals `_to` to maintain state consistency.
- **Default Queries:** Balance and ownership queries ensure direct referencing to internal mappings.

These postconditions ensure the interface behaves as expected per the ERC-721 specification, properly reflecting the operations on state variables after function execution.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:24:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations:
- **Balance Management:** The `balanceOf` function directly correlates the return value with the number of tokens an owner holds.
- **Ownership Verification:** The `ownerOf` function ensures the returned address matches the recorded owner of a token.
- **Approval Management:** Methods like `approve` and `setApprovalForAll` establish or update approvals correctly.
- **Token Transfer Operations:** Functions such as `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` guarantee that the ownership, approval state, and balance state of involved addresses are correctly updated.
- **Confirmation of Operator Authorization:** Ensures that `isApprovedForAll` accurately reflects the correct approval status for operators.

These specifications ensure alignment with ERC-721 compliant implementations, ensuring functional correctness, state change tracking, and proper transactional logic handling.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Annotations:
- **Balance Queries:** The `balanceOf` ensures that the balance accurately reflects the number of tokens owned by `_owner`.
- **Ownership Verification:** The `ownerOf` function checks that the `_tokenOwner` is correct for the queried `_tokenId`.
- **Approval Management:** The `approve` and `setApprovalForAll` functions manage and update allowed addresses for NFT management appropriately.
- **Transfer Effects:** Functions like `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` update ownership, balances, and reset approvals correctly. They also handle self-transfer scenarios where `_from == _to`.
- **Operator Authorization:** The `isApprovedForAll` function correctly expresses the approval status for an operator.
- **Contract Receiving Capability:** The `safeTransferFrom` variant includes a condition for contracts to accept NFTs through the `onERC721Received` hook.

These annotations ensure that the ERC-721 contract functionality and compliance are verified according to specified behaviors and constraints.

#### Key Details:

- **Balance Queries** accurately reflect the number of NFTs for a given address.
- **Ownership Verification** checks for the rightful owner of an NFT.
- **Approval Management** ensures setting of approvals is recorded correctly.
- **Transfer Operations** handle ownership updates, count adjustments, and cleaning approvals as well as self-transfers.
- **Contract Receiving Capability** in `safeTransferFrom` checks for appropriate response from smart contracts using `_ERC721_RECEIVED`.

These postconditions ensure the interface behaves according to the ERC-721 rules, with clear expectations for changes to state variables and compliance with standard constraints.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:25:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
- **View Functions:** Ensure the return value directly corresponds to the state variable they relate to.
- **Transfer Operations:** Update ownership, balance, and handle self-transfer scenarios where `_from == _to`.
- **Approval Handling:** Resets approvals on transfer completion.
- **Contract Compatibility:** In `safeTransferFrom`, checks whether `_to` is a contract and handles the response of `onERC721Received`.

These align with the ERC-721 standard, accounting for state updates, view validations, and appropriate handling of smart contract interactions.
