=== USER [2025-04-16 14:46:34] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf**: Assures the `_owner` is not zero and links the return value directly to the `_ownedTokensCount` mapping.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures the returned `_owner` matches the `_tokenOwner` of the given `_tokenId` and that it’s not zero.
3. **approve**: Updates `_tokenApprovals` for the `_tokenId` and verifies permissions.
4. **getApproved**: Links the return directly to `_tokenApprovals` for `_tokenId`.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Associates `_operator` approvals in the context of the caller.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Directly relates the return to `_operatorApprovals`.
7. **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**: These functions ensure ownership transfer, update owner counts, and ensure the `_to` address is not zero.

These annotations are consistent with the requirements of the ERC-721 standard, accurately reflecting expected contract behavior and state transitions.

### Explanation

This solution covers formal postconditions for each function according to their expected behavior in the ERC-721 standard:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures that `_owner` is not a zero address and returns the `_ownedTokensCount` directly.
- **ownerOf**: Ensures consistency between `_owner` and `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`, confirming non-zero owner address.
- **approve**: Establishes or verifies `_approved` as the `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` and proper authorization.
- **getApproved**: Relates `approved` return to the relevant stored value.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Captures changes to the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Assesses truth with logical consistency.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom (two variants)**: Cover state changes for ownership, maintaining that post-transfer balances and ownerships are correctly updated, with checks ensuring `_to` is not zero and self-transfers are properly handled. Additionally, `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is reset to the zero address post-transfer. 

These annotations reflect expected behaviors per ERC-721 and help ensure function integrity through verifiable conditions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:47:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the formal verification conditions for the given smart contract, we need to ensure that the added postconditions reflect the actual contract logic and adhere to the ERC-721 standard.

### Explanation

Each function has been annotated with appropriate postconditions:

- **balanceOf**: Verifies that `_owner` is not a zero address and returns the value from `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf**: Checks that the returned `_owner` is correctly assigned and valid.
- **approve**: Validates that `_approved` is set properly for `_tokenId` following correct permissions.
- **getApproved**: Confirms that the return `approved` matches stored state.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Assures that the `_operatorApprovals` are updated based on `_approved`.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the current operator approval status for a given `_owner`.
- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**: These conditions ensure proper transitions of ownership, validation on `_to` address non-nullity, update on balances, and reset `_tokenApprovals` post-transfer. All handle self-transfer conditions aptly.

With these postconditions, the behavior aligns with ERC-721 standards, facilitating formal verification of the contract's intended operations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:48:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the non-zero address requirement and reflects the owned tokens count for `_owner`.
- **ownerOf**: Reports the owner of `_tokenId` and ensures it's valid (non-zero).
- **approve**: Sets or reaffirms approval ensuring the sender's authorization either as owner or approved operator.
- **getApproved**: Matches the queried approved address to stored data.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures the mapping of operator approvals is accurately updated.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Validates and returns the operator's approval status for `_owner`.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**: Implements ownership transfer, adjusting balances accordingly, resetting `_tokenApprovals`, and preventing invalid `_to` addresses. Both versions guarantee appropriate updates for all related variables following a transfer.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - Ensures `_owner` is not the zero address (as addresses with zero balances are considered invalid by the standard).
   - Confirms the `balance` return value equals the `_ownedTokensCount` mapping value for `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - Ensures the owner returned is the actual `_tokenOwner` for the `_tokenId`.
   - Confirms `_owner` is not zero, as zero is not a valid owner address.

3. **approve**: 
   - Sets the `_tokenApprovals` mapping for `_tokenId` to `_approved`.
   - Requires msg.sender to be the current owner or an approved operator.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - Links the return value directly to the `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - Updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping status for `_operator` on behalf of `msg.sender`.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - Returns the current state of operator approval status for `_owner`.

7. **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom (both variants)**: 
   - Ensure the ownership of `_tokenId` is transferred from `_from` to `_to`.
   - Adjusts `_ownedTokensCount` for both `_from` and `_to`.
   - Resets `_tokenApprovals` for `_tokenId` upon transfer completion.
   - Guarantees the non-zero address check for `_to` is adhered to, preventing transfers to zero addresses.

By incorporating these conditions, the postconditions align with the functionalities detailed in the ERC-721 standard providing clear expected state transitions after each function execution.

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: 
  - Ensures the address `_owner` queried is not zero.
  - Confirms that the returned `balance` exactly matches the entry for `_owner` in `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: 
  - Confirms the returned `_owner` is the address associated with `_tokenId`.
  - Ensures the retrieved owner address is not the zero address since it’s invalid for NFTs.

- **approve**: 
  - Ensures the `_tokenApprovals` mapping for `_tokenId` is set to `_approved`.
  - Confirms msg.sender is either the owner or an approved operator.

- **getApproved**: 
  - Ensures the `approved` return value reflects the mapping entry `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: 
  - Updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping to reflect the new state of authorization for `_operator`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: 
  - Ensures the return value accurately represents the approval status from `_owner` to `_operator`.

- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom (both variants)**: 
  - Assures the NFT is transferred from `_from` to `_to`.
  - Adjusts the `_ownedTokensCount` for both `_from` and `_to` accordingly, storing the correct values before transfer.
  - Resets the `_tokenApprovals` for `_tokenId` to zero.
  - Handles transfers preventing `_to` being zero address and confirms `_to` receives the NFT.

These postconditions accurately reflect the intended behavior of each function per the ERC-721 standard, providing rigorous assertions about state changes that result from successful function execution.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:52:08] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of the Postconditions:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the queried `_owner` is not the zero address, and then confirms the returned `balance` matches `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.

- **ownerOf**: Confirms that the returned address `_owner` corresponds to `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` and is not the zero address.

- **approve**: Ensures that `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is set to `_approved`. It also guarantees that either `_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender` or the caller is an authorized operator.

- **getApproved**: Ensures that the returned `approved` address corresponds to the currently approved address for `_tokenId`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]` to `_approved`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns whether `_operator` is approved to manage all assets of `_owner`.

- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom (both variants)**: Handle self-transfer cases and update state accordingly. Conditions ensure:
  - The owner of the token before transfer is `_from`.
  - After transfer, `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` is updated to `_to`.
  - The balances of `_from` and `_to` are updated: 
    - `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` is decremented by 1.
    - `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` is incremented by 1.
  - The approval for `_tokenId` is cleared by setting `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to the zero address.

These annotations are designed to maintain consistency across related functions and match the provisions of the ERC-721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:52:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of the Postconditions:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the non-zero requirement for `_owner` and confirms the `balance` corresponds to the value in `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Guarantees the owner address of `_tokenId` is valid (non-zero) and matches `_tokenOwner`.

- **approve**: Assigns `_approved` as the controller for `_tokenId` and ensures that the function caller is either the current owner or an authorized operator.

- **getApproved**: Confirms that the `approved` address directly corresponds to what's stored in `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]` to reflect whether approval is granted or revoked.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Provides a direct link to the operator approval status for `_owner` and `_operator`.

- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom** (both variants):
  - Verifies that `_to` is not the zero address.
  - If `_from` and `_to` are the same, ensures that `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` remains unchanged.
  - Changes ownership of the NFT to `_to` and updates `_ownedTokensCount` for both `_from` and `_to` accordingly.
  - Clears `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` upon completion ensuring no lingering approvals after transfer.

These annotations are designed to address the requirements set out by the ERC-721 standard while facilitating formal verification through clearly articulated conditions.

### Explanation of the Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: 
   - Ensures `_owner` is not a zero address.
   - Confirms that the `balance` accurately reflects `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - Ensures `_owner` corresponds to `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.
   - Guarantees `_owner` is not a zero address.

3. **approve**: 
   - Sets `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to `_approved`.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - Reflects the approved address for the `_tokenId` from `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - Ensures `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]` reflects the intended approval status (`_approved`).

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - Confirms that the function's return value matches `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

7. **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom (both variants)**:
   - Assures the transfer is executed only if `_to` is not a zero address.
   - For self-transfers (`_from == _to`), ensures that ownership remains consistent.
   - Updates ownership and adjusts `_ownedTokensCount` accurately for both `_from` and `_to`.
   - Resets `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to zero. 

These annotations define clear behavioral expectations for each function, aligning with the robustness required by the ERC-721 standard.

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Confirms that the `_owner` is not the zero address, which is invalid.
   - Matches `balance` to `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that `_owner` is non-zero and related to `_tokenId` via `_tokenOwner`.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Updates `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to `_approved`.
   - Ensures correct authorization (either the owner or an authorized operator).

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Reflects `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` directly as `approved`.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Reflects `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]` for the input `_approved`.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Links directly to `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

7. **`transferFrom`/`safeTransferFrom` (all variants)**:
   - Ensures non-zero address for `_to`.
   - Self-transfer condition: If `_from == _to`, ownership stays, and no count changes.
   - Adjusts `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` and `_to` upon transfer.
   - Clears `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

These annotations are consistent and reflect expected behavioral changes inline with ERC-721, facilitating formal verification of each function execution path.
