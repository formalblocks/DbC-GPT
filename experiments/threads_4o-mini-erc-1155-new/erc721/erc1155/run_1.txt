    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This annotated code should now correctly express the core logic and expected outcomes of each function as prescribed by the ERC721 standard, with the conditions check reflected in postconditions as required by the solc-verify tool.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:43:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations aim to faithfully represent the intended behavior of each function according to the ERC721 standards. Each postcondition makes sure the state changes and permissions match the ERC expectations. Please note that smart contracts should be manually tested and verified in various real-world conditions beyond the formal verification annotations.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 14:43:57] ===
To annotate this ERC721 smart contract interface with correct formal verification postconditions, we need to ensure the postconditions align with the expected behaviors per the ERC721 standard. Here's a corrected version of the interface with formal verification annotations using `solc-verify`.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /**

    */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
    */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

```

Each function now contains postconditions that align with the expected behavior outlined in the ERC721 standard, ensuring that functions behave correctly and that state transitions occur as expected. This includes handling proper ownership and approvals, ensuring the correct tracking of token ownership, and checking conditions for authorized transfers.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:44:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

```

Here are the annotations explained:

 - `balanceOf`: Confirms that the balance corresponds to the number of tokens owned by `_owner`.
 - `ownerOf`: Confirms the owner of a given token is correctly returned.
 - `approve`: Ensures either the token owner or an approved operator can approve another address, and `_tokenApprovals` is updated correctly.
 - `getApproved`: Confirms the approved address for a token id.
 - `setApprovalForAll`: Updates the approval status for operators.
 - `isApprovedForAll`: Ensures the `isApprovedForAll` boolean reflects the correct operator approval status.
 - `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions: Ensure `_to` is valid, the caller is authorized, ownership is transferred correctly, balances are updated, and approvals are reset.

These annotations leverage map states with `__verifier_old_uint` for pre-state checks, and ensure functional behavior aligns with ERC721 standards.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:44:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points

1. **balanceOf**: Validates that `_owner` is not the zero address and `balance` equals `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures the token exists and the owner is correctly identified.
3. **approve**: Checks that only the owner or an approved operator can approve another address, and updates `_tokenApprovals`.
4. **getApproved**: Confirms that `_tokenId` is valid and returns the approved address.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the operator approval status for an owner.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Returns whether `_operator` is approved to manage all of `_owner`'s assets.
7. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Cover transfer conditions including ensuring `msg.sender` is allowed to transfer the token, and that ownership and token approvals are correctly updated post-transfer.

This annotation correctly follows the ERC721 standard while retaining logical consistency across related functions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:45:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures the queried account is valid and returns the correct balance from `_ownedTokensCount`.
2. **ownerOf**: Confirms the token exists and identifies the correct owner.
3. **approve**: Checks that `msg.sender` is either the owner or an approved operator of the token and correctly assigns the approval.
4. **getApproved**: Verifies the `_tokenId` validity and returns the correct approved address.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the operator approval status, setting `_approved` for `_operator`.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Checks the current approval status for `_operator`.
7. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: These ensure that:
   - The new owner address `_to` is not zero.
   - The transfer is authorized either by ownership, approval, or operation.
   - Ownership and token balances are adjusted accordingly.
   - Token approval is reset post-transfer.

The annotations ensure that these functions reflect the expected state changes and conditions based on the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:45:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points
- Each function includes postconditions that directly correspond to expected changes or state queries based on the ERC721 specification.
- Functions for approvals ensure that either the owner or an authorized operator can perform these actions.
- Transfers observe proper updating of ownership and count of owned tokens, including validation that the `_to` address is not zero.
- Consistency is maintained between different ways to transfer tokens (i.e., `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`).

These annotations enable formal verification of the contract's logic, ensuring that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard.

To provide the necessary formal verification annotations for the ERC721 smart contract interface, let's correctly add postconditions for each function based on the ERC721 standard. The annotations will ensure that function behaviors align with the expected contract state transitions.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _owner != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition balance == _ownedTokensCount[_owner]
    */
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition _owner == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
    */
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition (_tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)) 
        * @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender])
        * @notice postcondition _approved == address(0) || (_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved)
    */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
    */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
        * @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)
        * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
        * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1
        * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1
        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
    */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
        * @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)

        * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1
        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
    */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
        * @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
        * @notice postcondition _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
        * @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _from || _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)

        * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1
        * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
    */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Annotation Details

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the `_owner` is valid and the returned balance matches `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf**: Confirms the NFT exists and `_tokenOwner` correctly identifies the owner.
- **approve**: Checks that only the NFT owner or an authorized operator can set `_approved`. Also accounts for setting approval to the zero address to revoke approval.
- **getApproved**: Ensures the token is valid and retrieves the correct approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates and ensures the approval status for all assets of `msg.sender` managed by `_operator`.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies and returns the approval status of the `_operator`.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Ensure:
  - The `_to` address is non-zero.
  - "`msg.sender` must be the owner or authorized". 
  - Ownership and counters update correctly.
  - Reset of `tokenApprovals` post transfer.

These annotations capture the required logic to verify that each function performs its role per the ERC721 standard, ensuring continuity and consistency across operations.
