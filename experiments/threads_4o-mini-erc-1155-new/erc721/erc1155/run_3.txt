=== USER [2025-04-16 14:54:03] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These postconditions are carefully designed to ensure that the functions correctly adhere to the ERC-721 standard, accounting for the key aspects like ownership changes, token approvals, and the maintenance of state invariants.

**Explanation of Postconditions:**

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the returned balance matches `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
- **`ownerOf`**: Verifies that the returned owner corresponds to `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.
- **`approve`**: Confirms that the `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is updated to the new `_approved` address.
- **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Sets `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]` to the new `_approved` status.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures the return value matches `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- **`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom` (with and without data):** Verifies that the token ownership is transferred by updating `_tokenOwner`, `_ownedTokensCount`, and clearing token approvals.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points in Annotations:

- **Transfer Functions** (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`): Ensure ownership change only occurs if `_from` is not equal to `_to`. If a transfer is a self-transfer, the ownership and count changes should not apply, effectively maintaining state equality.
  
- **Balance and Ownership Query Functions** (`balanceOf`, `ownerOf`): Reflect state accurately as per the mapping of token ownership and count.

- **Approval Functions** (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`, `getApproved`, `isApprovedForAll`): Maintains correct approval state, ensuring authorization validity and confirming approval updates within mappings. 

These annotations are structured to cover token ownership, transfer validation, NFT approval, and operator checks aligning with the ERC-721 specification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:55:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **`balanceOf`**: Returns the number of tokens owned by `_owner` as stored in `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **`ownerOf`**: Matches the stored owner of the `_tokenId` in `_tokenOwner`.

3. **`approve`**: Sets the approved address for a token without any constraints on `_approved` since it can be set to the zero address.

4. **`getApproved`**: Reflects the approved address for a token as set in `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for `_msgSender()`, indicating if `_operator` is approved or not.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures the queried approval status from `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Validate that the `_tokenId` is transferred correctly from `_from` to `_to` except when it's a self-transfer.
   - Adjust `_ownedTokensCount` correspondingly, unless it's a self-transfer.
   - Ensure the `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is cleared (reset to zero address) after a transfer, as per EIP-721’s specification which requires approvals to be cleared after a transfer.
   
These annotations ensure consistency and accuracy with the expected behavior of the ERC-721 standard functions.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures returned balance matches `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.

- **`ownerOf`**: Confirms the owner's address for `_tokenId` as `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.

- **`approve`**: Allows setting the approved controller for a token as `_approved`, and ensures authorization through ownership or operatorship.

- **`getApproved`**: Returns `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`, matching the approved address for the token.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Sets or revokes `_operator` approval for all of `msg.sender`’s assets in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Validates if an `_operator` is authorized to manage all assets of `_owner` through `_operatorApprovals`.

- **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensures the token ownership transfers correctly, updating `_tokenOwner` and adjusting `_ownedTokensCount` for the `from` and `to` addresses, but correctly handling self-transfers where `_from` equals `_to`.
  - Resets `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to address zero after transfer, ensuring compliance with the standard by revoking any existing approval on token transfer.

This version of the annotations aligns with the ERC721 standard and enables a structured approach for verifying contract behavior.

### Explanation:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Verifies that the return value equals `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]` and that `_owner` is not the zero address.

2. **`ownerOf`**: Ensures that the returned owner matches `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.

3. **`approve`**: After calling, the approved address for `_tokenId` should be set to `_approved`.

4. **`getApproved`**: Returns `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures the operator approval status is updated in `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]`.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms that the function checks the approval status for `_operator` to manage all assets of `_owner`.

7. **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` (both functions)**
   - Verifies that the `_tokenId` is transferred from `_from` to `_to`.
   - Updates the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` and `_to`, reducing and increasing them correctly unless it's a self-transfer.
   - Clears any existing approval for the `_tokenId` by setting `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to zero.

The annotations accurately reflect the behaviors and requirements specified by the ERC-721 standard and allow for formal verification of contract functions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:57:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

- **`balanceOf`**: Confirms that `_owner` is non-zero and the balance matches the `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
- **`ownerOf`**: Ensures that the returned owner matches the stored value in `_tokenOwner`.
- **`approve`**: Sets the approved address for the NFT and is checked correctly.
- **`getApproved`**: Returns the approved address stored in `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Sets the operator approval and updates `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Evaluates the stored approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **Transfer Functions (`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`)**:
  - When the transfer is from one account to another, updates for `_ownedTokensCount` are verified correctly, taking care of self-transfer cases where `_from` equals `_to`.
  - Clears any previous approval for `_tokenId` after transfer, ensures reallocation of ownership.
  
These postconditions reflect the expected ERC721 behavior and compliance with its specification for token ownership management.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:57:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures `_owner` is not the zero address and the balance returned is equal to `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.

2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the returned owner is the current owner of `_tokenId` as stored in `_tokenOwner`.

3. **`approve`**: Sets `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to `_approved`, provided the caller is the owner or an authorized operator for the owner.

4. **`getApproved`**: Checks that the function returns the address currently approved for `_tokenId`, corresponding to `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Reflects that every change in operator approval status is recorded in `_operatorApprovals`.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the operator status returned is the one stored in `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

7. **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` (both versions)**:
   - Guarantee successful ownership change of `_tokenId` to `_to`.
   - Adjust `_ownedTokensCount` accordingly for `_from` and `_to`, accounting for the self-transfer where `_from` equals `_to`.
   - Clear any token approval in `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` after the transfer, maintaining ERC721 standards.

These conditions ensure each function complies with the expected ERC721 contract behavior and maintains a robust system for managing and verifying ownership and approvals in a non-fungible token setting.

### Explanation:

- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures `_owner` is not the zero address and that the returned balance equals `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
  
- **`ownerOf`**: Verifies that the returned owner corresponds properly to `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.

- **`approve`**: Confirms that `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is set to `_approved`. Only the owner or an authorized operator can call this.

- **`getApproved`**: Assures that the approved address returned aligns with `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures updates to `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]` reflect the new `_approved` status.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Guarantees that the return value equates to `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

- **`transferFrom`, and `safeTransferFrom`**:
  - Ensures if not a self-transfer, the owner of `_tokenId` is updated to `_to`.
  - Updates `_ownedTokensCount` for both `_from` and `_to` unless it's a self-transfer.
  - Clears the approval from `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` post-transfer, consistent with the ERC721 standard.

These conditions ensure each function complies with the expected ERC721 contract behavior, preserving integrity in NFT ownership and approvals.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:58:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To properly annotate each function in the ERC721 interface with formal verification postconditions using `solc-verify`, we must ensure that the annotations accurately represent the expected behavior in accordance with the ERC721 standard. Here's how each function can be annotated:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

    mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

```

### Breakdown:

- **Self-transfers**: Special handling is added for cases where `_from == _to`, retaining ownership and counts.
- **Transfer Functions**:
  - Ensure correct ownership updates to `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.
  - Update `_ownedTokensCount` adequately, accounting for both transfer and self-transfer cases.
  - Clear approvals for the token being transferred, consistent with ERC721 standards.

These annotations are designed to reflect the accurate and expected behaviors of the ERC721 token standard, following the changes in token ownership and ensuring the contracts' internal integrity.
