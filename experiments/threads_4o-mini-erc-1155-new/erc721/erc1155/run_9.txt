    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

In this annotated smart contract, each function includes postconditions that express the expectations and changes in the state or return value, consistent with the ERC721 standard. These annotations are intended for formal verification with tools that understand the specified syntax, such as solc-verify, ensuring conformance to the expected behavior in various scenarios such as successful or unsuccessful calls and state transitions.

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the balance returned matches the recorded `_ownedTokensCount` and checks that `_owner` is not the zero address.
- **ownerOf**: Ensures the returned owner is recorded in `_tokenOwner` and `_tokenId` is valid.
- **approve**: Ensures that the approval action is assigned correctly and verifies caller's permission.
- **getApproved**: Validates that the token is valid and returns the current approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping is correctly updated.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the correct boolean value indicating whether an operator is approved.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Check if the `_to` address is valid, the token has correctly changed ownership, and the counts reflect the transfer action, while also ensuring approvals are reset.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:21:44] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the owner is not a zero address and returns the count of tokens owned by `_owner` from `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf**: Ensures `_tokenId` is valid (owner is not the zero address) and returns the address of the owner from `_tokenOwner`.
- **approve**: Updates the approved address for `_tokenId`, with permissions verified for `msg.sender`.
- **getApproved**: Retrieves the approved address, making sure `_tokenId` exists.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the approval status of an operator for the caller.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Checks if `_operator` is approved by `_owner` for all assets, verifying the state of `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Check that `_to` is a valid address, transfer the ownership, update the count of owned tokens, and reset approval for the given token ID. 

These updates adhere to the ERC721 standard, ensuring proper handling of state changes and reflecting expected behaviors of NFT management.

        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Here is the annotated smart contract interface for `IERC721` with appropriate `solc-verify` postconditions for each function. In this revision, I'll ensure the conditions align with the function requirements and avoid previous issues related to type checking and undeclared identifiers:

```solidity

```

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the queried owner is valid and returns the correct balance.
- **ownerOf**: Ensures that the token ID is valid (has an associated owner) and returns the current owner.
- **approve**: Ensures only authorized callers can approve, and the token approval is updated correctly.
- **getApproved**: Ensures token validity before returning the approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets or revokes operator approvals, ensuring they're correctly updated.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the correct approval status for the operator.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Handle transfers with checks on recipient validity, updates token ownership, maintains ownership counts, and resets approvals after transfer. Special handling ensures the checks reflect true ownership state before and after transfer actions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:22:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Checks the queried owner's address is valid and reflects the count from `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf**: Ensures `_tokenId` is valid by checking that it has an associated owner, then confirms that owner is returned.
- **approve**: Ensures only the current token owner or an approved operator for the token owner can call it, and sets approval accordingly.
- **getApproved**: Ensures the token is correctly queried, returning its current approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Records the operator approval changes, ensuring consistency in approvals state.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Directly retrieves the correct approval status from the `_operatorApprovals` mapping, confirming if an operator is authorized.
- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: Handle the transfer logic, confirming that `_to` is well-defined, updates owner mappings and counts appropriately, and resets the token's specific approval status. Additional postconditions handle the scenario when a token is transferred to itself. 

These notations are designed for use within `solc-verify` to facilitate the contract's formal verification, ensuring it complies with the expected ERC721 standard behavior.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:22:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 15:23:08] ===

### Key Verifications:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]` accurately reflects the balance.
- **ownerOf**: Validates that `_tokenId` has a valid owner and returns the correct address.
- **approve**: Ensures permission conditions are met for approval and the correct mappings are set.
- **getApproved**: Validates retrieval of the approved address for a token.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates operator approvals consistently to reflect the latest status.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms if `_operator` is approved by `_owner`, returning the correct boolean.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**: Ensures transfer conditions are valid, updates mappings and counts, and clears approval for the transferred NFT. The postcondition also makes sure `_to` isn't zero, ensuring compliance with the standard's requirements for successful and verified transfer operations. 

This complete annotation set should improve contract reliability by verifying significant post-conditions and subtly managing various cases, simultaneously ensuring efficiency in the verification process.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 15:23:46] ===
To properly annotate the `IERC721` contract according to formal verification guidelines, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected changes to the contract state following each function's execution. Below is the contract with `solc-verify` annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

```

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the `_owner` address is not zero and returns the correct balance from `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf**: Confirms the existence of the token by asserting its ownership is not the zero address and returns it.
- **approve**: Allows only the token owner or an approved operator to change the approved address.
- **getApproved**: Ensures the token is valid and returns the approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates the approval status for the operator, ensuring state consistency.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Directly correlates the result with the approval mapping state.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**: Enforces non-zero recipient, verifies the owner before the transfer, updates counts, reassigns ownership, and resets approvals.

These postconditions help maintain correctness and transparency in the contract's state changes, aligning with ERC721 standard behaviors that are critical for non-fungible token handling.

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:24:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Let's update the `IERC721` interface with proper `solc-verify` annotations for formal verification of postconditions.

### Key Points of Annotations:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned is directly tied to the `_ownedTokensCount` for the `_owner`.
- **ownerOf**: Confirms that the returned owner is the one recorded in `_tokenOwner` for the given `_tokenId`.
- **approve**: Validates that only the token owner or an authorized operator can change approval and that this change is reflected.
- **getApproved**: Checks the validity of `_tokenId` before returning the stored approval.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets the approval state for all tokens owned, ensuring it accurately reflects changes in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms the approval status is correctly returned from `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**: These functions handle ownership transfer by changing the `_tokenOwner` and adjusting `_ownedTokensCount`, ensuring `_to` is not zero and clearing the `_tokenApprovals` for the transferred token. Postconditions ensure these updates are correctly mirrored by recording the previous state with `__verifier_old_uint()`.

These adjustments should effectively encode the expected behaviors and state changes for ERC721 token operations, maintaining the standard’s integrity.

### Key Explanation of Annotations:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance accurately reflects `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]` provided that `_owner` is not the zero address.
- **ownerOf**: Confirms `_tokenId` has a valid owner and returns it.
- **approve**: Validates the permissions for the approver, ensuring `_approved` is stored for `_tokenId`.
- **getApproved**: Checks if `_tokenId` is valid and retrieves the approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates `_operatorApprovals` to reflect the `_approved` status.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Retrieves the operator approval status for `_owner` as set in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**: Ensures `_to` is not zero, verifies ownership, transfers the token, updates owner balances, and clears `_tokenApprovals` for the transferred token. Special care is taken to check the consistency in transfer while accounting for the current and previous states using `__verifier_old_uint`.

These annotations capture expected behavior changes with respect to ERC721 while confirming transitions and outcomes using existing state variables in a way that suits the formal verification methodology (`solc-verify`).

=== USER [2025-04-16 15:24:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Validates that the query is for a non-zero address and returns the correct balance.
- **ownerOf**: Confirms that the NFT has a valid owner and checks the ownership mapping to return the correct owner.
- **approve**: Ensures only valid entities (owner or authorized operator) can set approval, while updating the `_tokenApprovals` mapping.
- **getApproved**: Returns the currently approved address for the provided token ID, assuming the token ID is valid.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Properly sets and reflects operator approval status.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies the operator approval state is correctly retrieved and returned.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom**: These functions ensure that the ownership is correctly transferred (with a valid `_to`), ownership counts are accurately updated, and any existing token-specific approvals are cleared.

These annotations ensure that the expected functionality aligns with the ERC721 standard and provides robust verification conditions for the specified methods using `solc-verify`.
