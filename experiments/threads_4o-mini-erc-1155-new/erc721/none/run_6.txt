    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

#### Key Postconditions:
- **balanceOf():** Validates that `_owner` is not the zero address, and returns the correct balance.
- **ownerOf():** Validates the ownership of the NFT for the given tokenId, ensuring the owner is not set to the zero address.
- **approve():** Ensures `_approved` is set only if the sender is authorized by being the owner or an approved operator.
- **getApproved():** Confirms the approval for the given tokenId or returns zero address if not set.
- **setApprovalForAll():** Establishes the operator approval status.
- **isApprovedForAll():** Confirms if an operator is approved for all assets of the owner.
- **transferFrom(), safeTransferFrom():** Ensure valid transfer constraints including ownership checks, non-zero target address, and token transfer representation. Additionally, it checks for smart contract compatibility during safe transfers with data.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:08:44] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes:
- **balanceOf():** Ensures querying a non-zero address and relates the return value to `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf():** Ensures the non-zero ownership of `_tokenId`.
- **approve():** Confirms approval assignment by an authorized user.
- **getApproved():** Ensures approved address correctness for `_tokenId`.
- **setApprovalForAll():** Updates operator approval status.
- **isApprovedForAll():** Checks for operator approval status.
- **transferFrom(), safeTransferFrom():** Handles NFT transfer, ensuring correct preconditions and updates to ownership and token count, requiring authorized action, and ensuring correct addresses.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:09:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

- **balanceOf():** Verifies that `_owner` is not the zero address and returns `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
- **ownerOf():** Verifies that `_owner` is the recorded owner of `_tokenId`.
- **approve():** Ensures the approval mapping is updated if the sender is the owner or an operator.
- **getApproved():** Returns the approved address for a given token.
- **setApprovalForAll():** Manages operator approval for an entire set of tokens.
- **isApprovedForAll():** Returns whether an operator is approved for all tokens of an owner.
- **transferFrom(), safeTransferFrom():** Handles the transfer of ownership, ensuring conditions are met as per ERC721 and updating balances.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Postconditions Explained:
- **balanceOf():** The `_owner` must not be the zero address, and the function returns the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_owner`.
- **ownerOf():** Ensures that the returned `_owner` is equal to `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` and not equal to the zero address.
- **approve():** Updates `_tokenApprovals` for `_tokenId` if the sender is authorized.
- **getApproved():** Return value must match `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.
- **setApprovalForAll():** Changes `_operatorApprovals` for the sender and `_operator`.
- **isApprovedForAll():** The return value for querying operator approval status matches the stored approval values.
- **transferFrom():** Checks that the transfer adheres to ERC specifications: proper ownership, address validations, and updates the ownership mappings.
- **safeTransferFrom():** Similar to `transferFrom`, but with additional checks for receipts on smart contracts.

These annotations ensure that the interactions comply with the ERC721 standard, querying balances, checking approvals, and executing transfers of ownership with correct state updates.

### Key Postconditions:

- **balanceOf():** Ensures that the `_owner` is valid and returns the exact token count from `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf():** Checks that the returned `_owner` corresponds to `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`, which cannot be a zero address.
- **approve():** Updates the `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` only if `msg.sender` is the owner or an approved operator.
- **getApproved():** Returns the correct approved address.
- **setApprovalForAll():** Ensures the state of operator approvals is properly updated.
- **isApprovedForAll():** Confirms the state of operator approval as `isApprovedForAll`.
- **transferFrom() and safeTransferFrom():** Validates proper ownership transfer, assures token count consistency, authority validation, and ensures the destination address is non-zero.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:11:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Postconditions Explained:

- **balanceOf():** Ensures `_owner` is not the zero address and that the returned balance reflects `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf():** Validates that the owner returned is the actual owner as per `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`, and that this is not a zero address.
- **approve():** Ensures that only the current owner or an authorized operator can approve and the correct update of `_tokenApprovals`.
- **getApproved():** Confirms the approved address is correct for the specified `_tokenId`.
- **setApprovalForAll():** Ensures proper setting of `_operatorApprovals` for the given operator relative to the sender.
- **isApprovedForAll():** Verifies return of the correct boolean value indicating if `_operator` is approved for all tokens of `_owner`.
- **transferFrom() and safeTransferFrom():** Ensure correct handling of token ownership transfer, account balance updates, and authority verification. They also ensure that target addresses are non-zero and that the `msg.sender` has the authority to initiate the transfer.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:11:44] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

### Key Points:

- **balanceOf():** The `_owner` must not be the zero address, and the function returns the correct `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf():** Ensures the return address matches `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` and is non-zero.
- **approve():** Checks authorization before updating `_tokenApprovals`.
- **getApproved():** Returns the correct approved address for the token.
- **setApprovalForAll():** Reflects approval or revocation of an operator's control over all asset tokens.
- **isApprovedForAll():** Shows correct operator status.
- **transferFrom() and safeTransferFrom():** Validate ownership transfer, balances update, and approvals based on authorization. The destination address `_to` must be valid (non-zero).

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]

        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Annotations:
- **balanceOf():** Ensures the `_owner` parameter is non-zero and the returned balance equals `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
- **ownerOf():** Confirms the function correctly identifies the owner of `_tokenId`, who must not be the zero address.
- **approve():** Validates that only the owner or an authorized operator can alter `_tokenApprovals`.
- **getApproved():** Ensures the function accurately returns the current approved address for `_tokenId`.
- **setApprovalForAll():** Reflects whether `_operator` approval for `msg.sender` is correctly set to `_approved`.
- **isApprovedForAll():** Validates that returns reflect whether `_operator` is a manager for `_owner`'s entire portfolio.
- **transferFrom() and safeTransferFrom():** Confirm ownership transfer, adjust account token counts, and verify sender's authorization and valid non-zero destination address.

### Explanation of Key Annotations:
- **balanceOf():** Validates that `_owner` is not the zero address and verifies `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]` is returned correctly.
- **ownerOf():** Ensures the returned `_owner` matches `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` and is not a zero address.
- **approve():** Confirms that only authorized users (owner or approved operators) can set approvals.
- **getApproved():** Confirms that the returned approved address matches `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.
- **setApprovalForAll():** Verifies the correct update of operator approval states.
- **isApprovedForAll():** Validates return of `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` as a boolean.
- **transferFrom() and safeTransferFrom():** Ensure correct state updates, validate senders' authorization, and calculate ownership/counts accordingly. Handle self-transfers (`_from == _to`) gracefully without reducing owned token counts.
