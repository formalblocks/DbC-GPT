=== USER [2025-04-16 12:52:03] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:52:30] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Each function's postconditions aim to ensure the state variables reflect the actions performed, and are consistent with the ERC721 specification requirements. Note that `isApprovedForAll` postcondition requires logical translation. Adjust logical expressions accordingly to match function results in real implementations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:52:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

I've adjusted postconditions to ensure compilation without errors and proper logical consistency with ERC721 standards. These postconditions should help verify expected behavior while treating each function appropriately according to the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:53:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Postcondition Points:
1. **balanceOf & ownerOf**: Ensure non-zero address checks to avoid invalid NFT transactions.
2. **approve**: Update approval status while ensuring the caller’s authority.
3. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensure consistency with stored operator-approval mapping.
4. **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Update ownership and balances accurately.

These annotations ensure that the state after each operation adheres to the expected conditions of ERC721 transfers and approvals. Adjustments reflect both ownership and approval mappings related to token operations.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf** and **ownerOf**:
   - Check for non-zero addresses to ensure the requestor is legitimate and to prevent queries on invalid NFTs.

2. **approve**:
   - Valid and zero-out conditions for approvals ensure that only the approved or intended approver is recorded.

3. **getApproved**:
   - Directly relate the return value to the `_tokenApprovals` mapping.

4. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Check if the operator approval status updates correctly for `msg.sender`.

5. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Direct verification of the returned bool's correspondence with stored status in `_operatorApprovals`.

6. **transferFrom**,  **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Properly update ownership and counts while clearing any previous approvals.
   - These functions additionally maintain owner check conditions and ensure post-transfer approvals are zeroed.

By setting appropriate postconditions, we can formally verify the contract actions and ensure they follow ERC721 standards correctly.

### Key Changes and Considerations

1. **balanceOf**: Ensure it handles zero addresses appropriately and returns the correct balance based on `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**: Reflects direct ownership retrieval from `_tokenOwner`, highlighting no change in conditions besides state validation.

3. **approve**: Validates approval alteration based on ownership or operator approval, subsequently setting `_tokenApprovals` correctly.

4. **getApproved**: Directly linked to `_tokenApprovals` status, ensuring it returns exactly as stored.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the `_operatorApprovals` mapping's update status for transaction initiators.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Removes potential syntax issues by ensuring it logically corresponds with existing `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom** / **safeTransferFrom**: Include integrity checks on ownership transition, balance adjustments, and approval resets after transfers. Each function checks that balances are properly updated when NFTs are transferred. 

8. The usage of `__verifier_old_uint` assists in maintaining consistency when referencing state before function execution, a common practice for comparison in annotations.

These postconditions are framed to accurately encompass the operational flow documented within the ERC721 standard while maintaining syntactical alignment with `solc-verify` expectations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:54:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points
- **Owner Consistency**: Ensure token ownership is not misrepresented, especially for self-transfers.
- **Balance Handling**: Ensure correct update of balances upon transfer, with special cases for self-transfers.
- **Approval and Authorization**: Maintain invariant conditions around token approvals and operator settings.
- **Fail Conditions**: Maintain clear paths to handle scenarios where the intended operation cannot be completed due to restrictions or errors.

By organizing these postconditions accurately, the contract's intended logic is maintained, verified, and protected against common errors or malicious uses.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 12:54:58] ===
To annotate the ERC721 interface accurately for formal verification with `solc-verify`, it's important to correctly express the conditions to fit the requirements and avoid compilation errors. Here’s how to do that:

```solidity

### Key Annotations and Considerations:

- **Consistency with ERC721**: Each annotation ensures that the postconditions follow the expected behavior of the ERC721 standard, like ownership changes, balance updates, and approvals.
  
- **State Preservation**: Utilizes `__verifier_old_uint` to ensure the state change is as expected and relates to initial values.

- **Prevent Zero-Address Issues**: Validations ensure that none of the operations involve interactions with zero addresses, as per the standard.

- **Approvals**: Correctly reset and align token approvals, especially after transfers.

These postconditions ensure that operations are valid and consistent within the state of the contract, as intended by the ERC721 standard. The conditions are laid out to match actions and effects, encouraging proper verification while eliminating improper conversions or comparisons.

### Explanation:

1. **balanceOf & ownerOf**: Postconditions ensure the return values are directly tied to the underlying state variables without exposing internal state inconsistencies.

2. **approve & getApproved**: Validate that approval operations reflect actual changes expected in the mapping, specifically resetting approvals if necessary.

3. **setApprovalForAll & isApprovedForAll**: Ensure that setting operators reflects expected states directly within the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Postconditions cover ownership transfer, decrement and increment of owned token counts for `_from` and `_to` respectively, and the revocation of any existing token approval for that token.

These annotations guard against unexpected states and ensure the contract behaves according to the stipulated ERC721 specifications. All functions are following their intended logical flow, particularly concerning ownership and approval mechanics.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:55:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures no query is made for the zero address and validates that the return matches the balance from `_ownedTokensCount` for that owner.

2. **ownerOf**: Asserts that the `_tokenId` exists and connects the return value directly to `_tokenOwner`.

3. **approve**: Validates that the caller is authorized to approve, either as the owner or designated operator, and updates `_tokenApprovals` as intended.

4. **getApproved**: Ties the returned approval address directly to `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the contract state reflects the given authorization for operators.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Directly checks equivalent conditions between the function return and the storage mapping on operators.

7. **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom** (both versions):
   - **Ownership Transfer**: Confirms new ownership.
   - **Balance Update**: Validates decremented and incremented balances for `_from` and `_to`.
   - **Approval Reset**: Makes sure any explicit token approval is cleared.

By integrating these verification conditions, the smart contract aligns more closely with the ERC721 standard, providing clearer guarantees about its operation and expected post-state conditions.
