    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Details:**

- **View Functions**: Postconditions are directly linked to state variables. For example, `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` postconditions ensure returned values correlate with `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner`.
  
- **Approval and Transfer Functions**: Ensures the appropriate change in `_tokenApprovals`, `_operatorApprovals`, `_tokenOwner`, and `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **Consistent Postconditions**: Postconditions are consistently applied across related functions (e.g., `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` consistently update `_tokenOwner`, `_ownedTokensCount`).

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:02:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the owner is not the zero address and the balance returned matches the internal count.
- **ownerOf**: Ensures the returned owner address is the one recorded in `_tokenOwner` and is not a zero address.
- **approve**: Ensures the approval is set to `_approved` and only the owner or an operator can set an approval.
- **getApproved**: Returns the approved address directly from `_tokenApprovals`.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets the operator approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the boolean status of `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom**:
  - Checks NFT ownership before and after transfer.
  - Updates `_ownedTokensCount` for both sender and receiver.
  - Resets approvals on transfer.
- **safeTransferFrom (both versions)**: Similar guarantees as `transferFrom`, but includes additional handling for calling `onERC721Received` on contracts.

These postconditions reflect the state changes and conditions expected as per the ERC-721 standard, ensuring that functions perform as specified.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:03:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Validates that the `_owner` is not the zero address and the returned balance matches `_ownedTokensCount`.
  
- **ownerOf**: Ensures the returned owner address corresponds with `_tokenOwner` and is not the zero address.

- **approve**: Sets `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to the approved address if conditions are met (i.e., the sender is the owner or operator).

- **getApproved**: Corresponds to the address in `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Reflects updates in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the status found in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **transferFrom, safeTransferFrom**:
  - Validate ownership before and after the transfer.
  - Account for self-transfers to avoid over-decrementing counts.
  - Adjust `_ownedTokensCount` correctly for `_from` and `_to`.
  - Reset approvals on transfer. 
  
This setup adheres to the expected correctness and behavior of NFT ownership, approval, and transfer processes. The attention to special cases like self-transfers ensures correctness without unintended state modifications.

Let's add the proper postconditions to the `IERC721` contract functions while aligning with the ERC-721 standard, using proper verification annotations. We'll focus on clearly expressing behaviors such as transfers, approvals, ownership conditions, and operator approvals. This time, we'll ensure that identifiers match exactly as used, and remember that `_balances`, `_allowed`, and `_totalSupply` are not relevant here since they're not defined in the snippet.

### Key Points:

- **View Functions (`balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, `isApprovedForAll`)**: Relate directly to state variables, verifying ownership and approvals.
  
- **Approval Functions (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`)**: Update approval mappings, ensuring proper authorization.

- **Transfer Functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`)**:
  - Check changes in owner mappings.
  - Adjust owned token counts responsibly.
  - Handle self-transfers explicitly to avoid redundant changes.
  - Reset approvals upon transfer completion.
  
These postconditions adhere to the verified behavior stipulated by the ERC-721 standard, accommodating corner cases for ownership and future interactions with approved addresses and operators.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:05:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points in Annotations:

- **`balanceOf`**: Validation ensures the owner is not the zero address, and the balance directly reflects `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **`ownerOf`**: Verifies that the owner returned is the owner mapped in `_tokenOwner` and is not the zero address.

- **`approve` and `setApprovalForAll`**: Updates `_tokenApprovals` and `_operatorApprovals` consistently with authorization checks.

- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures the return boolean matches the internal mapping value reflecting operator status.

- **Transfer Functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`)**:
  - Transfers result in owner mapping update (`_tokenOwner`).
  - Ensures changes in `_ownedTokensCount` reflect the transfer, handling self-transfer appropriately.
  - Resets `_tokenApprovals` upon completion.
  
Adhering to the provided verification guidelines, these annotations reflect the functions' expected behavior within the contract while tackling edge cases like self-transfers and maintaining internal mapping consistency between approvals and ownerships.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:05:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Considerations:

- **Variable Name Consistency**: Ensured that all parameter names and state variables are used exactly as declared to match the contract requirements.
  
- **Ownership and Approval Logic**:
  - For view functions, ensure that result values are directly tied to relevant state variables reflecting ownership and approvals, using expressions like `__verifier_eq(result, _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator])`.
  - Mechanize transfer operations to reflect state changes in token owner records and count adjustments, mitigating redundant operations during self-transfers.

This setup should provide a consistent basis for verifying adherence to expected contract behavior while capturing key postconditions as per the task constraints.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:05:52] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:

- **balanceOf**: Relates returned balance directly to `_ownedTokensCount`, ensuring the owner is valid.
  
- **ownerOf**: Confirms the returned owner field matches `_tokenOwner` and isn't the zero address.

- **approve**: Verifies that the `_tokenApprovals` mapping reflects the new approval and checks access rights based on ownership or operator approval.

- **getApproved**: Confirms the returned value is exactly what's stored in `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Updates `_operatorApprovals` as per the given `_approved` value.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned approval status directly reflects internal mappings.

- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**:
  - Updates the owner of the `_tokenId`.
  - Adjusts balances accurately, handling self-transfer cases to prevent decrement errors.
  - Resets any approvals for the token after transfer.

These meticulous postconditions ensure functions not only comply with ERC-721 specifications but also preserve invariants critical for token management and transfer.

### Key Considerations:

- **View Functions (`balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, `isApprovedForAll`)**: Ensure return values are directly related to the relevant state variables reflecting ownership and approval status.

- **Approval Functions (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`)**: Reflect the necessary changes in approval mappings while respecting the caller's authorization.

- **Transfer Functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`)**:
  - Ownership is updated appropriately in `_tokenOwner`.
  - Balances in `_ownedTokensCount` are adjusted correctly, accounting for self-transfers.
  - Token approvals are reset post-transfer.
  - `_to` should be a valid address (non-zero) to prevent token loss.

These postconditions are designed to enforce and verify core ERC-721 contract properties, ensuring correct token management and compliance with the standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:06:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the output balance matches the _ownedTokensCount mapping for the owner, provided the owner is not the zero address.

- **ownerOf**: Confirms the internal mapping returns the token's owner and that this owner isn't the zero address.

- **approve**: Ensures the _tokenApprovals mapping reflects the new approval only if the caller is allowed to update it.

- **getApproved**: The postcondition confirms that the return value matches the token approval mapping directly.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures the _operatorApprovals mapping reflects the desired state change for the operator's approval status by the sender.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms the return boolean matches the internal mapping state that keeps track of operator approvals.

- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**: 
  - Verify ownership transfer by updating _tokenOwner.
  - Ensure the new owner address is valid.
  - Adjust _ownedTokensCount appropriately, factoring self-transfer scenarios.
  - Reset the _tokenApprovals for the transferred token, preparing it for future transfers.

These annotations ensure a robust and verifiable conformance to ERC-721's standard behavior, allowing static analysis tools to verify expected post-conditions after each function's execution.
