    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations specify that the state changes expected from each function align with the ERC721 specification and provide a formal way to verify expected outcomes. They ensure that changes in token ownership, approvals, and operator status adhere to expected behaviors dictated by the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:48:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Note: The postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` function was corrected to relate the return value directly to the expected condition checking the `_operatorApprovals` state. The syntax error from before is addressed here, ensuring proper formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:48:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- Each postcondition reflects the changes expected in the state of the contract after the function executes.
- For functions related to ownership (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`), postconditions ensure that NFT ownership and approval states are correctly updated.
- Functions `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` validate the respective view functionality relating to balances and ownership directly to their mappings.
- Functions involving approvals (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`) focus on the correct update of the `_tokenApprovals` and `_operatorApprovals` mappings.
- All conditions follow the guidelines of relating the expected results strictly to the state variables declared and ensure consistency between related operations.

These annotations should help in providing a baseline for correctly verifying ERC721 standard behaviors with formal methods using solc-verify.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:49:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:

- **balanceOf:** Ensures the function is not called with the zero address and returns the correct balance.
- **ownerOf:** Ensures the NFT has an existing owner (not zero) and returns it.
- **approve:** Updates the `_tokenApprovals` mapping correctly.
- **getApproved:** Returns the approved address for a given token.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Updates the `_operatorApprovals` mapping accurately.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Ensures the function returns the correct current approval status for an operator authorized by the owner.
- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom:** Ensure ownership is transferred, balances updated, and approvals reset properly, mirroring expected post-transfer state.

By adding these annotations, consistency with expected ERC standards is maintained, which helps in verifying the contract's behavior using formal methods.

Let's annotate the `IERC721` contract with appropriate solc-verify postconditions. In doing so, we'll make sure that each function correctly reflects the expected state changes according to the ERC721 standard. We'll address standard practices while noting that the contract's current design doesn't use `_balances`, `_allowed`, or `_totalSupply`, which are more typical in ERC20 contracts.

```

**Explanation:**

- **balanceOf:** Ensure the query is not against the zero address and returns the count from `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf:** Ensure the token has a valid owner that isn't the zero address.
- **approve:** Reflect that `_tokenApprovals` is updated as expected.
- **getApproved:** Validate the return of the correct approved address for `_tokenId`.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Confirm `_operatorApprovals` is updated with the desired approval state.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Return the current operator approval status.
- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom:** Ensure correct updates in owner and balances, nullify approvals and handle transfers as specified. Special case handling for self-transfers isn't necessary for ERC721 as they usually shouldn't be processed, hence they're guarded against by requiring `_from != _to`.

With these annotations, be sure to validate them within a testing framework using solc-verify or equivalent tools to ensure compliance and correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:49:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:

- **balanceOf:**
  - Ensure the `_owner` is not the zero address.
  - Ensure the balance returned matches the stored balance.

- **ownerOf:**
  - Ensure the NFT with `_tokenId` has a valid owner that isn't the zero address.

- **approve:**
  - Ensure `_tokenApprovals` updates correctly for `_tokenId`.

- **getApproved:** 
  - Ensure the return value matches the approved address for `_tokenId`.

- **setApprovalForAll:**
  - Ensure `_operatorApprovals` is updated correctly with the new approval status.

- **isApprovedForAll:**
  - Return the approval status for an operator as expected from the mapping.

- **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom** functions:
  - Ensure balances are updated correctly for `_from` and `_to`.
  - Ensure the NFT's owner is updated to `_to`.
  - Nullify any existing approval for the NFT.
  - Ensure that neither `_from` nor `_to` are the zero address.

These annotations provide a foundation for formal verification efforts, ensuring that contract behavior adheres strictly to expectations laid out by the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:50:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:

- **balanceOf:** Ensures the balance is queried only for non-zero addresses and directly corresponds to `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf:** Ensures that the `_tokenId` is valid (has a non-zero owner).
- **approve:** Updates the `_tokenApprovals` mapping correctly to the new approved address.
- **getApproved:** Returns the current approved address for the `_tokenId`.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Updates the entire `_operatorApprovals` for the sender/operator correctly.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Returns the correct approval status from the `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom:** Updates the ownership, balances, and resets approvals, ensuring transfers are always between valid (non-zero) addresses.

These annotations help maintain the expected contract behavior and serve as a guide for formal verification using solc-verify. If issues arise, they should be addressed with a focus on the interface's consistency and correctness relative to ERC721 standards.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:50:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Let's add postconditions to the `IERC721` contract to reflect the expected outcomes accurately, according to ERC721 standards. Please note that for view functions that simply retrieve data, the postconditions should map the return values to corresponding state variables. For state-changing operations, the annotations will reflect the changes to smart contract state.

Here's how you can properly annotate the contract:

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf, ownerOf, getApproved, isApprovedForAll:** View functions return directly related state data. Postconditions confirm the mapping between state variables and function output.
- **approve, setApprovalForAll:** State-changing functions update approval mappings as expected.
- **transferFrom, safeTransferFrom:** These functions should check that transfers update owners and balances correctly, reset approvals, and confirm valid addresses, applying similar postconditions to handle the core transfer logic within the ERC721 standard.

These adjustments are provided to enhance logical consistency and correctness while ensuring compliance with the ERC721 implementation guidelines.

### Summary:

- The view functions (`balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, `isApprovedForAll`) map to the values from the contract's state directly.
- Functions responsible for changing the state (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`, `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`) reflect changes directly related to approvals and transfers.
- Handling transfers ensures that the recipient address (`_to`) is never zero and updates balances accordingly, resetting any existing approvals.
- For completion, ensure a formal verification environment is set up to run these annotations, focusing on adherence to ERC721 behaviors and constraints.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:51:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Annotations:

- **balanceOf:** Ensures that the balance corresponds directly to the `_ownedTokensCount` for the `_owner`.
- **ownerOf:** Confirms the function outputs the correct owner for `_tokenId`.
- **approve:** Validates that the caller can approve the address, and post-transfer the `_tokenApprovals` is updated.
- **getApproved:** Guarantees the returned approved address for the `_tokenId`.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Ensures `_operatorApprovals` is updated correctly.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Returns the correct mapping status for operator approval.
- **transferFrom / safeTransferFrom:** Ensure a change of ownership is reflected accurately in the contract's state with adjustments to balances and revocation of token approval.

These annotations help structure the specification for verification and alignment with ERC721 token standards, focusing on guaranteeing that function executions exhibit expected behaviors concerning contract state changes.
