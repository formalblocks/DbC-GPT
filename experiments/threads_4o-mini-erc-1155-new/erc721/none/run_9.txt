    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Checks that the query address is not zero, and the return balance is equal to the mapping of the owner's count.
- **ownerOf**: Ensures the token has a valid owner and is not owned by the zero address.
- **approve**: Sets or reaffirms the approval for a token, throwing an exception if the caller is neither the owner nor an approved operator.
- **getApproved**: Determines the address approved for a given token ID, ensuring that token ID is valid.
- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the mapping of operator approval is set as expected.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies that the returned approval status matches the stored value.
- **Transfer Functions**: All `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions have postconditions to express ownership changes, ensuring ownership transfer to `_to` and adjustments to the `_ownedTokensCount` balances of `_from` and `_to`. They also include checks that address inputs are not zero and the sender has the requisite permissions as either an owner, approved party, or operator.

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Specifies that the `_owner` cannot be a zero address and the return balance should match the `_ownedTokensCount`.
  
- **ownerOf**: Ensures that the `_tokenId` has a valid owner who isn't a zero address and returns this address.

- **approve**: Assures that only the current owner or an operator can set `_approved` address for the `_tokenId`.

- **getApproved**: Returns the approved address from `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets the `_approved` status for `_operator` to access all of `msg.sender`'s tokens.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Expresses that `isApprovedForAll` relates directly to `_operatorApprovals`.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: These functions check that ownership is transferred from `_from` to `_to`. They assert changes in `_ownedTokensCount` for both addresses if `_from` is not equal to `_to`. The postconditions also handle the self-transfer case by checking if there are no changes when `_from` is equal to `_to`. Note the transfer assumption that NFTs are valid and owned by `_from`.

These conditions ensure adherence to the ERC721 standards while maintaining consistent verification with the contract's state variables.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:27:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the queried address is valid (non-zero) and returns a balance equal to the count of owned tokens as per `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Checks that the `_tokenId` has a valid owner who isn't a zero address.

- **approve**: Verifies that the sender is the owner or an approved operator, and sets the `_approved` address in `_tokenApprovals` for the here specified `_tokenId`.

- **getApproved**: Validates that the NFT is owned, ensuring the query doesn't involve a zero address owner, and returns the stored approval address for the `_tokenId`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the approval status of an operator for all assets by updating `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns a boolean state that checks the mapping of operator approval.

- **transferFrom**/**safeTransferFrom**: These functions transfer ownership and adjust the owned tokens count. The approval for `_tokenId` is set back to zero after the transaction. They handle different input methods but follow the same logic of updating state variables concerning ownership and approvals.

These postconditions ensure consistent function behavior as outlined in the ERC721 specification while strictly utilizing defined contract state variables.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
This annotated contract uses `solc-verify` to check postconditions in smart contracts. These postconditions help ensure smart contract correctness consistent with the ERC721 specification.

- **balanceOf**: It guarantees that the return value reflects the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_owner` and that `_owner` is a valid non-zero address.
  
- **ownerOf**: It confirms that `_owner` is a valid non-zero address owning the `_tokenId`.

- **approve**: It ensures the approval for `_tokenId` aligns with ERC721 requirements, allowing only the owner or an authorized operator to change `_tokenApprovals`.

- **getApproved**: Ensures the token owner exists and reflects its approval value (_tokenApprovals).

- **setApprovalForAll**: Certifies that the `_operator`'s approval status for all NFTs owned by `msg.sender` is updated as expected.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Provides truth about operator authorization for both addresses.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: These functions manage NFT ownership transfers and ensure adjustments in ownership counts and reset the approvals. They ensure that ownership is transferred, and approval is removed after the action, confirming transition legality and maintaining mappings correctly.

This setup ensures consistency and adherence to ERC721 standards, using state variables and accurately maintaining balances, approvals, and transfers.

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: The postconditions ensure that `_owner` is not a zero address, and the returned `balance` reflects the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_owner`.

- **ownerOf**: The postconditions indicate that `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` should not be a zero address, meaning the token must be valid, and `_owner` is expected to be the address associated with `_tokenId`.

- **approve**: The function confirms the NFT owner or an authorized operator can approve an address for the NFT. The postconditions ensure `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is set to `_approved`.

- **getApproved**: This postcondition checks that the `_tokenId` is valid and that the `approved` return value accurately reflects the current `_tokenApprovals` state for that token.

- **setApprovalForAll**: This postcondition makes sure that `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]` equals `_approved`, indicating the set approval status.

- **isApprovedForAll**: This postcondition correlates the function's return value with the state `_operatorApprovals`, ensuring accuracy of operator authorization status.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: These postconditions update the mappings and counters correctly when transferring ownership:
  - The ownership of `_tokenId` should be transferred to `_to`.
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` mappings for `_from` and `_to` are adjusted correspondingly (decrease for `_from` and increase for `_to`).
  - The approval for `_tokenId` is reset to the zero address after the transaction, aligning with standard ERC721 behavior across similar transfer-related functions.

These postconditions adhere to the ERC721 standards and cover the use of defined state variables effectively.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:28:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:

- **balanceOf**: Confirms the `_owner` is non-zero and returns a balance reflecting what is stored in `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Verifies `_tokenId` is owned by a valid account and returns the correct associated owner.

- **approve**: Ensures only the token owner or an authorized operator can approve, and records `_approved` for `_tokenId`.

- **getApproved**: Validates the existence of a valid owner for `_tokenId` and returns its approved address, or zero if none.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets or removes `_operator` as an operator for `msg.sender`'s NFTs as per `_approved` boolean.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms whether `_operator` is approved for controlling all of `_owner`'s NFTs.

- **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**:
  - Transfers `_tokenId` ownership from `_from` to `_to`.
  - Updates `_ownedTokensCount` for both addresses.
  - Resets approval for `_tokenId`.
  - Handles transfers where `_from` equals `_to` (self-transfer scenario), ensuring no change in ownership count when they are the same.

These guidelines provide a consistent, verifiable basis ensuring each function adheres to the defined behaviors and state transitions articulated in the ERC-721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:28:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

- **balanceOf**: Validates that the balance query is performed for a non-zero `_owner` and returns the count of NFTs owned.

- **ownerOf**: Ensures the requested `_tokenId` is valid (owned by a non-zero address) and returns the correct owner.

- **approve**: Checks that the caller can only approve if they are the owner or an authorized operator, and it sets the approval.

- **getApproved**: Ensures the token is valid and returns the correct approved address.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures `_operator` approval status matches the `_approved` provided for caller's NFTs.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Checks if `_operator` is authorized for all NFTs owned by `_owner`. 

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Each function performs these operations:
  - Ensures `_from` and `_to` addresses are non-zero.
  - Transfers `_tokenId` and updates ownership mappings.
  - Resets approval after transfer.
  - Adjusts `_ownedTokensCount` counts, handling self-transfer as a no-operation update when `_from` equals `_to`.

These steps provide a stringent verification ensuring function behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard, maintaining consistent and precise updates to state variables.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures the queried owner `_owner` is not a zero address and that `balance` correctly reflects their token count from `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Validates that `_tokenId` is linked to a valid owner, returned via `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`, ensuring this owner is not zero.

- **approve**: Confirms the approval can only happen if the caller is the current owner or an authorized operator, and ensures `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is updated to `_approved`.

- **getApproved**: Ensures the token exists, represented by a valid `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`, and consistent retrieval of `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Adjusts the `_operatorApprovals` status per `_approved`, maintaining correct operator permissions for `msg.sender`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned `isApprovedForAll` status accurately reflects the state of `_operatorApprovals` for the queried `_owner` and `_operator`.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Handle ownership transfer for `_tokenId`:
  - Confirms ownership transfer to `_to`.
  - Updates ownership counts correctly, including self-transfers (address doesn't change) with conditional counter adjustments.
  - Zeroes out the previous approval for `_tokenId` as per the standard after transfers.

This adherence to ERC721 standards ensures reliability and expected behavior through consistent state management and logic alignment with established contract practices.

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the `_owner` isn't the zero address and that the returned `balance` matches the `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **ownerOf**: Ensures the token is owned by a valid address and that `_owner` accurately reflects this.

- **approve**: Confirms that the caller is either the token owner or has been approved as an operator, setting the `_approved` address for `_tokenId`.

- **getApproved**: Verifies the existence of the token and retrieves the approval status for it if it's valid.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Adjusts operator approvals based on the boolean `_approved`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Returns the correct status if `_operator` is authorized by the `_owner`.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Handle the transfer of ownership:
  - Ownership of `_tokenId` is transferred to `_to`.
  - The balance counts are correctly updated for both `_from` and `_to`.
  - Approvals for `_tokenId` are reset post-transfer.
  - Special self-transfer handling where `_from` equals `_to` results in no change in ownership count.

These postconditions ensure conformity with ERC721 specifications and provide a strong basis for verifying that function implementations behave correctly with respect to state changes.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:30:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf**: Ensures that the `_owner` is checked for validity (non-zero), and returns a balance matching the mappings.

- **ownerOf**: Ensures that `_tokenId` refers to a valid token owner (non-zero address) and returns this owner.

- **approve**: Validates that either the owner or an authorized operator calls the function, and updates the approval entity for `_tokenId` accordingly.

- **getApproved**: Verifies that the token is valid (exists and owned) before accessing the approval information.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Adjusts the operator approval status, reflecting the input `_approved`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms the return value accurately mirrors the stored approval state for `_owner` and `_operator`.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Includes postconditions for transferring a token's ownership, ensuring the transfer is properly recorded by:
  - Transferring ownership to `_to`.
  - Correctly updating the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` and `_to`.
  - Handling self-transfers gracefully with no effective change in ownership count.
  - Resetting any existing approvals for `_tokenId`.

These conditions verify that function implementations align with state transitions and expected behaviors described in the ERC721 standard.
