    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

- **balanceOf**:
  - The balance returned must equate to the count of NFTs owned by the `_owner`, which is represented by `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
  - For the `zero address`, balance should always be zero.

- **ownerOf**:
  - The `_owner` should be the address stored in `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` and must not be the zero address.

- **approve**:
  - The approved address for the specified `_tokenId` should match the `_approved` address provided. A zero address is used to remove approval.

- **getApproved**:
  - The method returns the approved address for `_tokenId`, matching `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.

- **setApprovalForAll**:
  - Modifies `_operatorApprovals` to update the approval (true/false) from `msg.sender` to `_operator`.

- **isApprovedForAll**:
  - Returns whether `_operator` is approved to manage all assets of `_owner`, reflected in `_operatorApprovals`.

- **transferFrom (and similar Transfer functions)**:
  - The token ownership transfers to `_to`.
  - The balances update accordingly: decrease ownership count for `_from` and increase for `_to`.
  - Resets any existing approval for the `_tokenId` during transfer to maintain ERC-721 standard behavior.

Certainly! Let's address the verification requirements by properly setting the postconditions for each function in the `IERC721` smart contract interface. We will add postconditions, especially paying close attention to correctly updating the state variables during transfers and maintaining consistency between related functions.

### Key Adjustments and Explanations:

- **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` Functions**:
  - Ensure to handle addresses properly: `_to` and `_from` should not be the zero address.
  - Correctly decrement the `_from` balance and increment the `_to` balance.
  - Reset `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to the zero address post-transfer.

- **Approval Functions Postconditions**:
  - Ensure `_tokenApprovals` and `_operatorApprovals` mappings reflect the correct state after operations.

By these postconditions, we adhere to the ERC-721 standard, maintaining proper token ownership transfers and ensuring consistent state updates across related functions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:44:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Changes and Clarifications:

1. **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf` Functions**:
   - Confirm ownership and balance accurately reflect the state.

2. **`approve` and `getApproved` Functions**:
   - Properly update and verify the approval status of an NFT.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` and `isApprovedForAll` Functions**:
   - Ensure `_operatorApprovals` reflects the correct state.
   - Correctly updated `isApprovedForAll` postcondition to check against the actual result.

4. **Transfer Functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`)**:
   - Updated to track correct changes in ownership.
   - Validate updated state of `_tokenOwner`, `_ownedTokensCount`, and reset `_tokenApprovals` after a transfer.
   - Ensure correct balance shift between `_from` and `_to`.

These changes are designed to improve the robustness of state verification post-transactions, ensuring compliance and reliability with the ERC-721 standard.

Let's focus on revising the postconditions for each function of the `IERC721` interface, ensuring compliance with the ERC-721 specification while addressing the formal verification guidelines and error messages.

Here's the corrected contract with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;
    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;
    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

    /**
     * @notice postcondition (balance == _ownedTokensCount[_owner]) || _owner == address(0)
     */
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _owner == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]
     * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)
     */
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address _owner);

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved
     */
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
     * @notice postcondition approved == _tokenApprovals[_tokenId]
     */
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
     */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
     * @notice postcondition __result == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
     */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool __result);

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
     * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1
     * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1
     * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
     */
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
     * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1
     * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1
     * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
     */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /**
     * @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
     * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1
     * @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1
     * @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)
     */
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Added a condition to handle querying balance for the zero address.
2. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Specified the return variable as `__result` to ensure the postcondition matches.

3. **General Transfer Functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`)**: 
   - Ensures that ownership and balances update correctly.
   - Resets approval for the tokenId during any transfer.

These changes should help ensure correct state transitions and accurate error-free annotations for smart contract verification purposes.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:44:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Annotations and Clarifications
- Postconditions for view functions `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, and `isApprovedForAll` directly reflect the state variables they rely on.
- `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `safeTransferFrom` update the state variables post-function execution to enforce expected changes (ownership and approvals management).
- When dealing with operators (_operatorApprovals), true or false indicates the operator's approval status.
- Each `transfer` function checks the old and new balances to ensure validity before and after token ownership changes.
- Ensure `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` updates to `_to`, and the count adjustments for `_from` and `_to` address balances are consistent with state changes.

This setup respects formal verification guidelines strictly by using only state variables and remaining consistent throughout the contract.

### Key Adjustments and Reasoning:

1. **Handling Self-transfers**: 
   - We add conditions to account for self-transfers where the sender is the same as the recipient. Balances do not change in this scenario, and the ownership remains consistent.

2. **Check for Ownership Transfers**:
   - Ensures the `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` updates to `_to` and captures the old ownership count state for `_from` and `_to`.

3. **Approval Management**:
   - Resetting state changes related to `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` ensures no lingering approval after ownership change.

4. **Realistic View Function Postconditions**:
   - All view functions' return values are matched directly against the state variables, accurately reflecting current contract state.

These postconditions ensure the contract's behavior adheres to ERC standards while allowing for realistic verification and transition tracking by addressing specifics, such as self-transfers and approval resets.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:45:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

## Key Changes and Clarifications:

- **Ownership Checks in Transfers**: Postconditions now verify ownership updates between sender and receiver, handling both different and self-transfer cases.
  
- **Updates on Approvals**: Approval resets are confirmed post-transfer to prevent unauthorized transfers.
  
- **Correct Use of State Variables**: All view functions relate their return directly to declared state variables, ensuring that they provide the current contract state.

These changes ensure strong contract compliance with the ERC-721 standard, improving the robustness and reliability of this token implementation.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions

    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

### Key Corrections and Clarifications:

1. **View Functions**:
   - For `balanceOf`, we ensure the balance matches the count in `_ownedTokensCount`, except when `_owner` is the zero address (invalid).
   - `ownerOf` confirms ownership check against `_tokenOwner`.
   - `isApprovedForAll` checks prior state `_operatorApprovals` consistency directly in the postcondition.

2. **Approval Functions**:
   - `approve` simply updates the `_tokenApprovals` mapping based on approvals.
   - For `getApproved`, the return value is directly linked to `_tokenApprovals`.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - All transfers properly reassign ownership to `_to`, adjust `_ownedTokensCount` correctly, and reset approvals with distinct handling for state checks using `__verifier_old_uint`.

4. **State Variables Usage**:
   - Adhered to the usage of specified state variables exactly (posts/condition) to ensure consistency with the contract state transitions.
  
5. **General Considerations**:
   - There's an adjustment to states for sender-to-recipient count that's more accurate in preserving verification expectations.

These annotated postconditions are designed for clarity and adherence to ERC-721 standards, providing robust verification paths for smart contract functionality.

### Explanation: 

- **balanceOf**: Confirms that the return value equals the stored count of NFTs for the `_owner` (except if `_owner` is the zero address).
  
- **ownerOf**: States that the returned owner matches the data stored in `_tokenOwner` and the token cannot be assigned to the zero address.

- **approve**: Ensures that `_tokenApprovals` is updated correctly.

- **getApproved**: Verifies that the returned address matches the stored `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the mapping `_operatorApprovals` for the given `_operator` is set as approved or not, according to input.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures consistency between the queried approval status and the stored state.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Handles transfer logic, ensuring that ownership updates, balances decrease for `_from`, increase for `_to`, and approvals reset. Special care is given to self-transfers, where balances should not change.

These annotations properly reflect the expected changes to the contract state, enabling verification tools to catch potential errors and ensure compliance with the ERC-721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:47:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

- **Self-transfers**: Handled by checking if `_from` equals `_to` to prevent accidental balance changes.
  
- **`balanceOf` and `ownerOf` Functions**: Reflect contract invariants related to count and ownership.

- **Approval Functions (`approve`, `getApproved`, `setApprovalForAll`)**: Update the respective approval mappings and checks.
  
- **Transfer Functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`)**: 
  - Ensure ownership changes to `_to`
  - Adjust balances only when `_from` != `_to`.
  - Reset any existing token approval post-transfer.

- **Operator Approvals**:
  - Confirm whether an operator is approved based on internal mapping.

These conditions enforce proper ownership and asset management behavior, confirming that transfers and approvals align with ERC-721 expectations.
