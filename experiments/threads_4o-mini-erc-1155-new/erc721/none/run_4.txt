=== USER [2025-04-16 12:56:37] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These annotations are designed to provide formal verification for the specified behaviors of the ERC721 functions, ensuring that the state variables reflect the expected changes after each function call, aligning with the contract's semantics as per the ERC721 standard. The postconditions utilize the `solc-verify` syntax to ensure that these conditions are checked during verification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:57:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Thank you for providing the necessary information about the errors. Let's update the smart contract interface with correct formal specification annotations using `solc-verify`. Make sure the annotations use the correct syntax for referencing previous states with `__verifier_old_uint()` and adhere to the input guidelines.

```

In this version of the specification:
- The postcondition annotations indicate the expected changes in state variables such as `_tokenOwner`, `_ownedTokensCount`, and `_tokenApprovals` after each function call.
- The `__verifier_old_uint()` function ensures the use of previous state values for verification.
- Consistency of postconditions between related functions like `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` is now maintained.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:57:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **Mapping Access & State Change**: The postconditions check changes in the state variables like `_tokenOwner`, `_ownedTokensCount`, and `_tokenApprovals` based on actions taken in the functions.
- **Safety Checks**: Postconditions include checks to ensure the `_from` address loses one token and the `_to` address gains one token in functions that transfer ownership.
- **Verification**: Use of `__verifier_old_uint()` records the previous state of variables for comparison after changes in the function execution.
- **Consistency**: Postconditions ensure the logic remains consistent across different function variants that perform similar actions (transfer vs. safeTransfer).
- **Approval Handling**: The approval setting and revocation is covered with logical checks, allowing structured ownership and controller rights within the contract. 

This solution should fulfill the requirements for formal verification in `solc-verify` and ensure that the contract behaves according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:58:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation:
- **Balance and Ownership Queries**: The postconditions for `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` ensure correctness of querying account balances and token ownership.
- **Approval Functions**: For `approve` and `setApprovalForAll`, postconditions confirm the correct setting of token approvals and operator approvals.
- **Transfer Functions**: Transfer functions (both `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`) update the ownership mappings and correctly handle transfer logic, resetting approvals and adjusting owned tokens count while maintaining conditions to prevent transfers to invalid addresses.
- **Logical Consistency**: Ensures consistency with the ERC721 standard by checking sender approvals and managing state transitions.

These postconditions ensure the expected behavior of the ERC721 standard is followed and facilitate verification using `solc-verify`.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf / ownerOf**: Assert that the `_owner` is not zero and `balance` is derived from `_ownedTokensCount`, and `_owner` is derived from `_tokenOwner` for `_tokenId`.
- **approve / setApprovalForAll**: Assert that approvals are correctly assigned to `_tokenApprovals` and `_operatorApprovals`.
- **isApprovedForAll**: Directly equate the return value with the mapping check.
- **Transfer Functions**: Ensure ownership transfer, verify adjustment of `_ownedTokensCount`, and reset approvals for the transferred NFT.
  
The conditions are written to represent intended behaviors according to the ERC721 standard and to enable sound formal verification with `solc-verify`. Additionally, the previous syntax issue with `isApprovedForAll` is resolved by mapping the return value directly to the state variable without using an inappropriate type comparison.

### Key Points:
- **Address Checks**: Ensure non-zero checks for addresses where applicable to align with ERC721 standards.
- **Ownership and Approvals**: Correctly manage owner and approvals which reflect changes in state mappings.
- **Transfer Functions**: Postconditions reset approvals and adjust token ownership counts accurately.
- **Mappings Verification**: Consistently use mappings (e.g., `_operatorApprovals`) for queries and updates.
- **`solc-verify` Annotations**: Ensure the syntax properly references state conditions and uses `__verifier_old_uint()`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:59:49] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Considerations
- **Ownership and Count Balancing**: For balance-related functions like `balanceOf`, and ownership queries like `ownerOf`, ensure that postconditions accurately reflect the current state.
- **Approvals**: The `approve` method must correctly update the `_tokenApprovals` mapping, while `setApprovalForAll` updates `_operatorApprovals`.
- **Transfer Functions**: Ensures that state changes during NFT transfers are correctly depicted, including ownership updates, balances adjustments, and approvals reset.
- **Consistent Use of Mappings**: Queries like `isApprovedForAll` use the state mapping to check conditions and return values.

This structured formalization ensures the contract functions behave correctly as defined by ERC721 and prepares them for formal verification using the `solc-verify` tool.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:00:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Notable Aspects:
- **State Mappings**: The annotations use state variables accurately according to the ERC721 standard.
- **Ownership and Count**: Ownership transfers properly update the state, reflecting balance changes (`_ownedTokensCount`) and ownership details (`_tokenOwner`).
- **Resetting Approvals**: Postconditions ensure approvals are reset to `address(0)` post-transfer, which is a standard ERC721 requirement.
- **Approval Handling**: Approval-related functions (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`) update the relevant mappings as expected.
- **Operator Verification**: `isApprovedForAll` directly relates the return value to `_operatorApprovals` mapping, correcting the previously noted verification syntax issue.

These postconditions ensure compliance with the ERC721 standard and facilitate thorough verification using `solc-verify`.

### Considerations:
- **Condition Consistency**: Ensure all transfer-related functions maintain consistent postconditions reflecting state variable changes.
- **Correct Variable Use**: Use mapping updates correctly, e.g., `_tokenOwner`, `_ownedTokensCount`, and `_tokenApprovals`.
- **Self-Transfer Handling**: Include special handling when the sender and recipient are the same, ensuring no state changes occur in that specific case.
- **Error Correction**: Corrected the verification condition for `isApprovedForAll` by directly using `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`. 

These annotations should comprehensively cover the intended behaviors and facilitate rigorous formal verification using `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:01:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Points:
- **Balance and Ownership Functions**: Use mappings (`_ownedTokensCount`, `_tokenOwner`) for balance and ownership queries.
- **Conditional Logic for Transfers**: Handle self-transfers by applying conditions that maintain current state if `_from` equals `_to`.
- **Approve Functionality**: Ensure that a non-zero address approval is valid (either the current owner or an operator).
- **Post-transfer Resetting**: Ensure that `_tokenApprovals` is reset upon successful transfer.
- **Logical Consistency**: Transition of ownership and counts maintains consistency across transfer operations.
