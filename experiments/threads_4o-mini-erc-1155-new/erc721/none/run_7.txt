=== USER [2025-04-16 13:13:32] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To provide formal specifications for the ERC721 smart contract interface using solc-verify postcondition annotations, it's important to interpret each function's expected behavior accurately from both the function descriptions and the ERC-721 standards. Here's how to annotate each function with proper postconditions:

```solidity

In these annotations, we specify the expected states of contracts before and after function calls, assumptions on inputs (like not allowing zero addresses), and updates to mappings that represent ownership and approvals. These postconditions help ensure compliance with the expected functionality of the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:13:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To resolve solc-verify errors with the annotations and ensure we're following the ERC-721 specification, we need to specify precise formal verification postconditions for each function. Below, I'll present the annotated contract with verified formal conditions. I will also make sure to avoid mistakes that cause solc-verify errors, such as using `result` in annotations, which is undefined in the interface functions.

### Explanation

- **balanceOf(address _owner)**: Verifies that the balance returned matches the internal tracking (`_ownedTokensCount`) and ensures `_owner` is not a zero address.

- **ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId)**: Ensures the returned owner matches the `_tokenOwner` mapping for the given `_tokenId`, enforcing that the owner is not the zero address.

- **approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId)**: Establishes that the `_tokenApprovals` mapping reflects the new `_approved` address and verifies that `msg.sender` is authorized to approve the NFT.

- **getApproved(uint256 _tokenId)**: Validates the same approved address is returned as stored in the `_tokenApprovals` mapping and checks that the token is valid (not owned by the zero address).

- **setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved)**: Ensures that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping correctly records the approval status for `_operator`.

- **isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator)**: Confirms the correct value (approved) is provided according to the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Validates ownership transfer by checking mappings updates, ensuring `from` and `to` are valid, and setting approvals as required after transfer.

Note that postconditions must be consistent with each other and correctly reflect the defined behavior in the ERC specification. The annotations are written to align with ERC-721 requirements for state mutations through NFT transfers and approvals.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:14:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **Postcondition Adjustments**: For `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`, include conditions that address self-transfers where `_from` == `_to` to handle cases reflective of no change in ownership. Additionally, ensure that transfers do not proceed to `_to` being `address(0)`, aligning with pre-conditions in the standard.

- **Ownership and Approval Conditions**: Added checks and conditions for ensuring that the caller has the right authority to perform the transfer, whether they are the owner or have been approved for the specific token.

- **State Variable Conditions**: Carefully structured conditions to ensure the balance deductions and additions reflect actual changes only when applicable, ensuring correctness during execution.

By properly structuring these postconditions, we ensure compliance with ERC721 specifications and address potential verification errors by the solc-verify tool.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:15:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 13:15:54] ===
To address the errors and verify the contract's correctness, we need to accurately define the postconditions that reflect the smart contract's behavior according to the ERC-721 standard. The errors indicate that certain assumptions about the state of the contract might not hold true, so adjustments to the postconditions are necessary. Let's refine the postconditions for the `transferFrom` function and ensure all other functions are correctly annotated.

### Explanation

- **Function: transferFrom**:
  - **Owner Check**: Ensure that `_from` is indeed the owner of `_tokenId` initially. Remove the postcondition that `_from != _tokenOwner[_tokenId]` from the list and confirm `_from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId]` initially and transfer logic is correctly checked with the postconditions.
  - **Authority Check**: Include a condition to ensure caller (`msg.sender`) is authorized to transfer: either the owner, approved operator, or explicitly approved for the token.

- **Common Transfer Conditions**:
  - Confirm that after the transfer `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` is set to `_to` and that `_to` is not the zero address.
  - Approvals should be reset (`_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == address(0)`) after successful transfer to align with the ownership transfer logic.

These conditions ensure that the function aligns with the ERC-721 standard post-transfer logic, addressing potential ownership, transfer authority, and approval reset issues while ensuring consistency in contract state across related transfer functions.

        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Changes Explained

- **Balance Update Postcondition**: For self-transfers, ensure consistency by allowing no change in `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` when `_from` equals `_to`.

- **Authorization Check**: Clearly outline the conditions under which the transfer is authorized: the sender must be the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token.

- **Token Owner Verification**: Confirm that `_from` is the initial owner of the token using `__verifier_old_address()`, which tracks the previous state.

These updates to postconditions should address previous errors and ensure the function adheres to ERC-721 expectations.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

### Explanation

- **Postconditions for Transfers**: Ensure that if `_from` is equal to `_to`, the token count `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, it decreases by 1 for `_from` as the token moves to `_to`.

- **Authorization Checks**: Ensure the sender has valid permissions, by checking that they are the owner, approved operator, or have explicit approval for the specific token.

- **Balance Updates**: Reflect balance changes correctly in the conditions, ensuring the token count for the recipient (`_to`) increases by 1, while the owner's (`_from`) count decreases by 1 only when they are different.

By correcting these issues, the conditions align with the intended contract logic and reduce potential verification errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:17:49] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the provided owner is valid (not zero address) and the returned balance matches the internally tracked count.

- **ownerOf**: Ensures the return matches the recorded token owner and checks validity (non-zero).

- **approve**: Updates the `_tokenApprovals` mapping and authorizes only a token owner or operator to approve.

- **getApproved**: Reflects the currently stored approved address for a token in `_tokenApprovals`.

- **setApprovalForAll**: Sets operator approval status for all assets a caller owns, modifying `_operatorApprovals`.

- **isApprovedForAll**: Properly annotates using "result" instead of `approved` to match return value directly to the internal mapping state.

- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom**: Include conditions for transferring NFT ownership, handling balance updates, and requiring the caller's authorization (owner, approved, or operator). They reset the token approvals upon transfer and ensure `_from` and `_to` are correctly updated.

These annotations provide a comprehensive coverage of expected contract states before and after each function execution according to the ERC-721 specification. Addressing the verification concerns ensures contract consistency and alignment with ERC requirements.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.

### Key Fixes:

- **`isApprovedForAll` Function**: Changed the postcondition to use `result == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` to directly connect the return value to the state variable.
  
- **Authorization and Ownership Validation**: Ensures validation of ownership and the use of old state values with `__verifier_old_uint()` for correct comparisons in functions that alter state like transfers.

- **Approval Reset on Transfer**: Resets `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` to `address(0)` to ensure no lingering approvals after a transfer.

- **Self-Transfer Handling**: For self-transfers (where `_from == _to`), maintains the existing balance, ensuring no changes in `_ownedTokensCount`.

These specifications are consistent with the behaviors expected per the ERC-721 standard and should align with formal verification tools to verify the contract's correctness.

### Adjustments and Clarifications:

- **Ownership and Approval Logic**: Correctly ensure authorized users (owners, approved addresses, or operators) make changes, which includes verifying ownership preconditions with `__verifier_old_address` and `_ownedTokensCount`.

- **Postconditions in `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**: Correctly handle post-state conditions, including balance adjustments for `_from` and `_to`, particularly ensuring no change in balance if `_from` is the same as `_to`.

- **Logical Connection in `isApprovedForAll`**: Utilize a conditional logic to handle success and failure return cases.

- **Correct Usage of Annotations**: Ensure accurate use of annotations to match the intended logic of each function as per the ERC721 standard, ensuring post-state conditions validly reflect the ERC-721 actions. 

These enhancements ensure formal compliance with the expected behavior of the ERC721 standard and reduce the foreseeable verification errors based on the contract's functionality.


=== USER [2025-04-16 13:19:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation
1. **balanceOf and ownerOf**: Direct relation between return values and state variables with checks for zero address, ensuring compliance with ERC documentation requirements.
   
2. **approve**: Checks that only authorized actors (current owner or operator) can set approval and that the approval is set as specified.

3. **getApproved**: Ensures the return value matches the mapping for tokenId.

4. **setApprovalForAll**: Ties the approval status directly to the state variable.

5. **isApprovedForAll**: Uses `isApprovedForAll` as the return type to ensure consistency with function signature and directly relates it to the mapping value.

6. **transferFrom and safeTransferFrom**: Ensure ownership transfer logic is correct, including approval resets and handling of self-transfers where no actual ownership change occurs (`_from == _to`), hence no balance updates for `_from`.

By correctly specifying conditions in the interface, these postconditions ensure adherence to the ERC-721 standard while providing necessary verifications during state changes in a smart contract.
