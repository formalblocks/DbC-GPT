=== USER [2025-04-16 13:30:49] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These postconditions verify that the state of the contract behaves as expected for each function's purpose. The annotations also provide conditions that make sure that key constraints are met before and after the function execution.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:31:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These formal verification annotations ensure the contract behaves according to the ERC-721 standard specifications. Postconditions guarantee the correct state transitions and view function outcomes. For better verification, make sure you are using a solc-verify-supported compiler version.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:31:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

This version addresses the formal verification needs while ensuring the functions maintain the expected ERC721 standard behavior. The annotations incorporate necessary checks for permissions and handle NFT state transitions postconditions accurately.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:32:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

These postconditions capture the state changes that should occur in the contract, aligning them with the explicitly provided requirements. The correct handling of ownership transfers, approvals, and operator permissions are considered to ensure that the smart contract reflects expected business logic as per ERC721 standards.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:32:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Each function above has preconditions and postconditions that correctly model the expected state changes and value checks according to the ERC721 standard. These include validations of ownership checks, approvals, and ensuring state changes align with actions (e.g., token ownership transfer, approval resets).

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:33:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

In these annotations:
- Postconditions for `balanceOf` and `ownerOf` ensure the view functions return precisely what is stored in the respective state mappings.
- `approve` correctly updates the approval mapping for the `_tokenId`.
- The `setApprovalForAll` function updates operator approvals.
- Checks for the ownership change are present in `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`, with prior approvals reset.
- `isApprovedForAll` postcondition verifies if the operator is approved for all tokens.

### Explanation:
- **balanceOf:** The balance queried is the number of tokens the `_owner` holds according to the mapping `_ownedTokensCount`.
- **ownerOf:** Verifies and returns the address of the owner of the given token, `_tokenId`.
- **approve:** Authorizes a new address (`_approved`) to manage the particular `_tokenId`, updating the `_tokenApprovals`.
- **getApproved:** Returns the approved address for the specified `_tokenId`.
- **setApprovalForAll:** Sets or unsets the `_approved` status for `_operator`'s ability to manage all tokens of `msg.sender`.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Returns if `_operator` is approved to manage all of `_owner`'s assets.
- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom:** Ensure tokens are transferred from `_from` to `_to` effectively by updating ownership, balances, and approvals accordingly. Also validates who is authorized to initiate transfer actions.

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf and ownerOf:** Ensure that the functions accurately reflect the owner's NFTs by checking against `_ownedTokensCount` and `_tokenOwner`.
- **approve and getApproved:** Validate the management of approved addresses for NFTs.
- **setApprovalForAll:** This modifies operator status.
- **isApprovedForAll:** Verifies operator status over all of an owner's NFTs.
- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom:** Ensure rightful ownership transfer and updates for counts and approvals effectively. Each ensures proper checks for `_from` ownership and clears approvals post-transfer.
  
These annotations help maintain clarity on the expectations and results from these operations according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:35:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To resolve the issues with solc-verify and to correctly annotate the ERC721 contract interface, I'll provide proper postconditions for each function, making sure they align with how states and returns should be handled according to the ERC721 standard:

```solidity

    mapping(uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

    mapping(address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

### Key Points:
- **balanceOf and ownerOf:** Ensure view functions directly return values from mappings related to the owner's token information.
- **approve and getApproved:** Manage and verify NFT approvals correctly with a focus on how `_tokenApprovals` is updated.
- **setApprovalForAll and isApprovedForAll:** Set and return operator approval status consistently with respect to `_operatorApprovals`.
- **transferFrom & safeTransferFrom:** Ensure these functions properly handle ownership transfers by checking and updating the `_tokenOwner`, `_ownedTokensCount`, and `_tokenApprovals`. Confirm that the transfer adheres to rules about valid owners and addresses.

This careful annotation ensures consistency with ERC721 and proper state transition upon function calls.
