=== USER [2025-04-16 11:42:39] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

These annotations specify the expected behavior of each function in the ERC20 contract in relation to the state variables and inputs, consistent with the ERC20 standard. They ensure the correct verification of expected outcomes or changes in state after each function is executed.

### Key Adjustments:
- The conditions ensure the function updates balances and allowances as per the parameters, with fallback in case of unsuccessful operations.
- Correctly handle cases for self-transfers and authorized spending.
- Make sure that preconditions for sufficient balance/allowance are fulfilled for transfers.

These modifications aim to ensure the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of each function according to the ERC20 standard, and should encourage smooth verification without the previous errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:44:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

To address the error in the `transfer` function and ensure that all functions have accurate postconditions, let's refine the postconditions to accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions, addressing any potential reason for the failure of the `transfer` function verification. Here's the annotated contract with the corrected postconditions:

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value && success) || (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) && !success)
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- **Transfer Function**: Added a postcondition that implies success only if `_balances[msg.sender]` was greater than or equal to `_value` initially. This reflects the requirement that the sender must have enough tokens to allow the transfer.
- **Consistent Logic**: Consistency across `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions ensuring both handle authorized balances and updates correctly across the success/failure scenarios, indicating that functions only succeed if initial conditions are met. 

These changes should ensure the conditions hold for all verified paths, improving the reliability of the `transfer` function and preventing errors during verification.

- **Verification Clarity**: Ensured verification conditions are stated in a way that relates directly to the function's potential success and failure paths.
- **Balance Check**: Added direct postconditions checking sufficient balance and allowance for successful operations.
  
These changes should ensure that the conditions are correctly verified and aligned with the standard ERC20 logic and the guidelines provided.

To address the verifier errors for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, let's refine the postconditions to correctly represent the necessary checks for successful executions, and ensure they hold under all circumstances (both success and failure). Here is the complete annotated smart contract interface:

```solidity

```

### Key Adjustments:
- **Balance and Allowance Checks**: Added explicit balance and allowance checks postcondition for successful operations to make sure funds and permissions are adequate.
- **Self-Transfer Handling**: Ensured there are no balance changes or authorization checks required if `_from` is the same as `_to` in `transferFrom` or `msg.sender` is `_to` in `transfer`.
- **Completion Condition Handling**: Addressed both success and failure scenarios where state should remain unchanged if unsuccessful.

These changes should result in the verifier validating the logic under different state conditions as stipulated by the ERC20 standard.

}
```

### Changes and Adjustments:
- **Balance and Allowance Checks**: Ensure that balance and allowance requirements are met at the beginning of operations and verified post-conditions have a proper logical path for both success and failure.
- **Self-Transfers**: Although self-transfers (`msg.sender == _to`) and (`_from == msg.sender`) cases are handled in logic, they don't need separate balance alterations by conditions if they result in unsuccessful outcomes.
- **Logical Sequencing**: Ensure success implies balance is deducted from sender and added to recipient unless it is a failure path, where state remains unchanged.

These changes should resolve the verifier's issues with the conditions by clearly specifying the expected balances after each function operation in accordance with the ERC20 standard.

### Explanation of Adjustments:
- **Logical Checks for Balances**: Ensure sufficient balance in the sender's account and proper handling for the scenario where `_from` is sending to itself.
- **Allowance Adjustment**: Consider whether allowances are adequate; also check that allowances aren't deducted erroneously when transactions aren't authorized.
- **Self-Transfer Handling**: Specifically capture the state changes (or lack thereof) for the scenario where `_from` is equal to `_to`.
- **Postcondition Consistency**: Ensures that state changes are accurately described under both successful and unsuccessful execution paths.

These changes aim to faithfully reflect the expected behaviors post-execution as described by the ERC20 standard, improving verification reliability.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

I will address the errors by refining the postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to better capture the necessary conditions for success and failure in line with the ERC20 standard. Here is the annotated contract with improved postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping(address => uint) _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value && success) || (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) && !success)
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Improvements:
- **Logical Expressions**: Reorganized logical expressions in postconditions to handle success and failure pathways cleanly, ensuring they reflect the intended state transitions.
- **Success Conditions**: Explained the balance changes directly through conditional postconditions depending on the success of the function call.
- **Self-Transfer Handling**: Special handling for self-transfers to maintain balances as static in such cases if the transfer is not successful.

By ensuring these conditions are explicitly stated, this should resolve the verification errors outlined and align the function behavior with the expectations from the ERC20 standard.

```

### Explanation:
- **Balance and Allowance Checks**: Ensure both conditions (`_balances[msg.sender] >= _value` for `transfer` and `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value` for `transferFrom`) are properly checked in postconditions for success.
- **Balance Non-Negativity**: Added conditions to prevent overflow by checking that the resultant balance shouldn't be less than zero.
- **State Preservation**: Ensure that if the transaction is unsuccessful, the balances and allowances remain unchanged.
- **Self-Transfer Handling**: Handled self-transfers ensuring no changes for such operations or when sender equals the receiver.

These annotated postconditions should satisfactorily address all paths, steering successful verification.
