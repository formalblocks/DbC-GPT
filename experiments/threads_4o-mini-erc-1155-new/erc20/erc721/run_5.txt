=== USER [2025-04-16 10:12:30] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- `totalSupply`: Ensures the returned `supply` matches `_totalSupply`.
  
- `transfer`: Validates:
  - Deduction from `msg.sender` and addition to `_to`, unless it is a self-transfer.
  - Balance conditions for zero transfers.
  - Success cases are treated similarly, considering consensus logic for `success` return.

- `transferFrom`: Includes:
  - Adjustments to both `_from` and `_to` for successful transfers.
  - Updates or preservation of allowance balance for `_from` and `msg.sender`.

- `approve`: Sets or updates `_allowed` amount for spender.
  
- `balanceOf`: Ensures the returned balance matches `_balances[_owner]`.

- `allowance`: Confirms returned remaining amount equals `_allowed[_owner][_spender]`.

}
```

### Explanation:

- **transfer**:
  - Checks that if `_to` is the same as `msg.sender`, it doesn't change balances.
  - Verifies that `_balances[msg.sender]` decreases by `_value` if `_value` transfers.
  - Verifies that `_balances[_to]` increases by `_value` unless `_to` is the same as `msg.sender`.
  - Ensures that `msg.sender` initially holds at least `_value` tokens.
  - Handles both the success and failure cases of the transfer operation.

- **transferFrom**:
  - Similar to `transfer`, it verifies that the allowance and balances are appropriately adjusted, verifying initial condition constraints for `_from` and `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]`.
  - Ensures that the allowance for `_from` by `msg.sender` decreases by `_value`.
  - Handles both the success and failure cases, requiring that proper allowances and balances are in place before deduction.

The revisions ensure we conform to both ERC20 expectations and verifiable logic, especially widely handling preconditions, including failure cases, ensuring invariants before concluding execution states.

### Explanation:

- **transfer**:
  - Ensures `_value` is either zero or that `msg.sender` has a sufficient balance.
  - Postconditions verify correct balance deduction from `msg.sender` unless it is a self-transfer (`msg.sender == _to`).
  - Ensures `_to` receives the transferred value, unless it is a self-transfer.
  - Handles both success and failure by verifying the conditional requirements for successful execution.

- **transferFrom**:
  - Ensures `_value` is zero or that `_from` has enough balance.
  - Ensures the transfer decreases `_from` balance unless a self-transfer (`_from == _to`).
  - Keeps `_to`'s balance updated after a successful transfer.
  - Reduces allowance correctly from `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]`.
  - Covers both success and failure scenarios, where success checks previous allowance/balance conditions are met.

These revisions are aimed at effectively capturing the necessary logic and state preconditions and postconditions as determined by the ERC20 specification and the specific guidelines of solc-verify syntax.

To address verification errors and ensure the correct behavior according to the ERC20 standard, we need to refine the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. Let’s revise the conditions considering the balance checks should be reflected properly according to the function's logic flow and the potential for both successful and unsuccessful transactions.

Here's the revised contract with postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **transfer**:
  - Addresses self-transfers appropriately by checking if `msg.sender == _to`.
  - Ensures balances are deducted and added correctly, maintaining consistency across success and failure cases.
  - Validates that `msg.sender` balance is sufficient when `success` is true.

- **transferFrom**:
  - Properly handles `_from`, `_to` transfers, adjusting balances accordingly.
  - Confirms that both balance (`_from`) and allowance (`_allowed`) reductions occur as expected only for successful outcomes.
  - Ensures the same checks on sufficient balance and allowance when `success` is true.

These adjustments are aimed at ensuring the smart contract adheres to the ERC20 standard requirements for successful execution and handling edge cases such as self-transfers and constraint validation in a way compatible with formal verification.

  - Ensures that transfers of `_value` tokens from `msg.sender` to `_to` are consistent with previous states, especially accounting for zero transfers.
  - Handles both cases correctly, ensuring balances are not deducted on self-transfers (`msg.sender == _to`).

- **`transferFrom`**:
  - Checks that `_from` has an adequate balance and has given sufficient allowance to the caller of the function.
  - Reinforces postconditions involving balance updates and consistency around both successful and unsuccessful states.
  - Addresses adjustment in balance only when transferring to different addresses, allowing updates in allowances according to transaction success status.

These postconditions help capture intent and expected outcomes, improving compliance with the ERC20 standard as verified by solc-verify, accommodating a function’s logic flow including zero-transfers, successful executions, and detailed state maintenance post-execution.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **transfer**:
  - The postconditions ensure that the operation only succeeds if `msg.sender` has a balance greater than or equal to `_value`.
  - The `balances` are updated correctly for both `msg.sender` and `_to`, except in the scenario where `msg.sender` equals `_to`.
  - Handles conditions where success is false, ensuring balances stay consistent.

- **transferFrom**:
  - Ensures that `_from` has sufficient balance and permit from `_allowed` to complete the transfer.
  - Updates `balances[_to]`, respecting the case where `_from` equals `_to`.
  - Handles both success and failure conditions to maintain balance and allowance consistency.

These conditions should satisfy the requirements, address discrepancies between the old and new states, and reflect the ERC20 standard’s specifications.

```

### Explanation:

- **transfer**:
  - If `msg.sender` is not `_to`, ensure sufficient high-level conditions for `_value` and success, including failure scenarios.
  - For self-transfers (where `msg.sender == _to`), validate that balances remain unchanged.

- **transferFrom**:
  - Ensures successful execution if `_from` has enough balance and the allowance for `msg.sender` is sufficient.
  - Post-execution, it ensures that `_balances[_from]` and `_balances[_to]` are consistent with prior state transitions.
  - Checks are included to ensure allowance deductions are correct upon success, but unchanged if unsuccessful.

- Error-checks have been incorporated to accurately capture the failed transaction conditions for both functions. This assures that state variables only reflect updated values when transaction conditions are fully met.

### Explanation:

- **`transfer`**:
  - Verifies that the sender has at least `_value` tokens unless the transfer involves the sender transferring to themselves (`msg.sender == _to`).
  - Ensures balance reduction for the sender (`msg.sender`), except for self-transfers.
  - Guarantees that the recipient (`_to`) balance increases by `_value`, or remains unchanged in case of failure or self-transfer.

- **`transferFrom`**:
  - For successful transfers, validates the sufficiency of `_from`'s balance and allowance.
  - Ensures balance and allowance reductions on completion when conditions meet, with special handling for self-transfers (`_from == _to`).
  - Checks that balances remain consistent if the operation does not proceed or if self-transfer occurs.

Postconditions are designed to validate state transitions under both success and failure, as well as to accommodate corner cases like self-transfers. This should align with ERC20 expectations and verification requirements.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the issues you encountered with `transfer` and `transferFrom`, let's refine the postconditions to ensure they align with the ERC20 specification and handle both success and failure scenarios appropriately. Each condition should properly represent the expected balance changes or lack thereof depending on whether the transaction succeeds.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && success) || (msg.sender == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && success) || (msg.sender == _to)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && success) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && success) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value && success) || (_from == _to)

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value) || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`transfer`**:
  - The first postcondition ensures that the operation can succeed only if the sender's balance is sufficient.
  - The second postcondition ensures the deduction from `msg.sender` happens only if the operation is successful, except in the case of self-transfer (`msg.sender == _to`).
  - The third postcondition ensures `msg.sender` adds the `_value` to `_to`, but only if the operation succeeds, maintaining the special case logic for self-transfers.

- **`transferFrom`**:
  - The first postcondition ensures the operation succeeds only if `_from` has sufficient balance and authorization (`_allowed`).
  - The subsequent postconditions ensure deducting the respective balance or alteration of `_allowed` only occurs upon a successful operation, accommodating exceptions when `_from` is the same as `_to`.

These annotations ensure that the state transitions correctly reflect the ERC20 specification for both successful and failed executions, as well as proper handling for edge cases such as self-transfers.

The errors you've encountered are due to the incorrect use of logical operators that are incompatible with types, especially when mathematical operations are combined with logical checks in the annotations. We need to adjust the postconditions to properly separate logic checks from arithmetic operations.

Here is the updated smart contract with correct annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping(address => uint) _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || (msg.sender == _to)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || (_from == _to)

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- Properly separate logical conditions from arithmetic calculations in the annotations.
- Ensure that state changes are accompanied by appropriate logic checks (`&& success` or conditions for `msg.sender == _to`).
- Handle logical cases and arithmetic state transitions independently to address conditions for success and failure explicitly.

By ensuring that operations are validated separately from logical checks, we avoid compilation errors and accurately define the expected ERC20 behavior in formal verification conditions.
