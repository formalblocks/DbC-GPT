=== USER [2025-04-16 10:03:53] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

Each function has been equipped with postconditions that specify the expected outcomes in terms of state variables and previous states, addressing each function's purpose as defined by the ERC20 standard. The conditions also ensure consistency and correct handling of return values and state changes for contract functions.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 10:04:26] ===
To ensure that the postconditions in the ERC20 smart contract are accurate and reflect the expected behavior per the ERC20 standard, we need to refine the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions' postconditions to handle various cases correctly, including insufficient balance scenarios, successful transfers, and events where `success` is false.

Below is the adjusted smart contract with updated postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    * If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value) || !success

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`transfer` function**: The postconditions now handle the following scenarios:
  - Successful transfer: `_balances[msg.sender]` decreases by `_value` while `_balances[_to]` increases accordingly.
  - Failing transfer: Balances remain unchanged.
  - Handles self-transfer correctly by maintaining the same balance post-transaction.
  
- **`transferFrom` function**: Similarly adjusted to handle:
  - Successful transfer: `_balances[_from]` decreases while `_balances[_to]` increases, and the allowance `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]` decreases.
  - Failing transfer: No change to balances or allowances.
  
These specifications will ensure correct verification and logical consistency with respect to the contract's expected behavior.

To resolve the verification errors for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we need to revisit the structure of the postconditions in these functions. The issues seem to arise with the handling of success conditions and ensuring the balance updates are reflected correctly. Let's revise these conditions for clarity and accuracy.

Here's how you can update the contract with revised postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || (_balances[msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) || !success)
    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || (_balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success)
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to])) || (_to != msg.sender || _value == 0)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method can be used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || (_balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) || !success)
    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || (_balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success)
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to])) || (_from != _to || _value == 0)
    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || (_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || !success)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
    * If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value) || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`transfer` function**: 
  - Postconditions account for the balance reduction from the sender and addition to the recipient. 
  - The `success` condition is explicitly considered, ensuring state changes occur only when `success` is true.
  - Special handling is added for transfers involving `_to` is the same as `msg.sender`.
  
- **`transferFrom` function**: 
  - Considers both balance and allowance adjustments only when `success` is true.
  - Handles zero-value transactions and ensures accurate state management in these cases.
  - Accounts for authorizations in place via `_allowed`.

This setup should ensure correct verification by aligning the postconditions with anticipated outcomes per the ERC20 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'

To fix the errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions while conforming to the ERC20 specifications, ensure the postconditions account for all possible cases, including edge cases like insufficient balance or allowance for the transaction.

Below is the revised code with corrected postconditions:

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Adjustments Made:
- **`transfer` function**: The postconditions ensure that balances are only adjusted when `success` is true. Additionally, zero transfers and self-transfers are handled without altering states inappropriately.

- **`transferFrom` function**: The postconditions address both balance and allowance adjustments, focusing on when `success` is true. It also accounts for zero transfers and verifies state conditions precisely. 

These specifications should correctly align with the behavior expected from an ERC20 token as per the standard.

### Revisions and Corrections:
- **`transfer` postconditions**: Consider both successful and self-transfer scenarios. Ensure that balances are only altered based on success, and handle the no-op state when `_value == 0` or a direct transfer case where `msg.sender == _to`.
  
- **`transferFrom` postconditions**: Cover changes in balances and allowances while ensuring that these changes occur only when the function succeeds. Handle cases when `_from == _to` to maintain balance integrity on self-transfers.

These changes should address the verification errors by exhaustively covering all expected outcomes according to ERC20's specification and the transaction flow paths.

Let's go through the necessary adjustments for the postconditions of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. We need to refine the postconditions to ensure they are correctly stating the logic that must hold true for all execution paths, especially concerning the success and failure cases, as well as self-transfers.

### Revised Smart Contract with Postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint256) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) _allowed;
    uint256 public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value && msg.sender != _to && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _to && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender])) || success || (!success && _value == 0)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && _from != _to && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_from == _to && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from])) || success || (!success && _value == 0)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
    * If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value) || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- **`transfer` and `transferFrom` functions:**
  - Ensure proper handling and accurate postcondition expressions for both success and failure cases by checking against the success and failure logic.
  - Handle the scenario when `_value == 0` properly as per the ERC20 standard, allowing for that path even if no balance changes.
  - Self-transfers (`if msg.sender == _to`) must leave balances unchanged, an essential condition within the postconditions.
  - Ensure that all state changes are properly calculated and tied to the 'success' of the operation, preserving the logical consistency expected by the ERC20 standard.

These corrected and precise postconditions should hold true across all paths of execution, complying with both typical and edge cases dictated by the ERC20 token standard.

}
```

### Explanation:
- **Handling Success and Failure**: Each function now includes conditions for both success and failure scenarios to cater to paths where state changes might not occur (e.g., insufficient balance).
- **Handling Zero Transfers**: Ensure that zero-value transfers, as required by the ERC20 standard, must behave like normal transfers.
- **Self-transfers**: Self-transfers are considered by checking `_from == _to` to ensure balance consistency.
- **Correct Updates**: Conditions are emphasized to check the balances and allowances against their old values properly.

These postconditions should ensure that the smart contract adheres to the expected behaviors as defined by the ERC20 standard.

It looks like there were issues in the previous annotations, specifically with incorrect variable names and missing handling of all required scenarios. Let's refine the annotations so they conform with the ERC20 standard and fix those errors.

Here’s the corrected and properly annotated version of the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value && (success || msg.sender == _to) && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && (success || msg.sender == _to)) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && (success || _from == _to) && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && (success || _from == _to)) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
    * If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value) || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- **Variable Name Correction**: Changed `!_success` and `localVarName` to consistent correct referencing like `success`.
- **Postcondition Logic**: Conditions explicitly detail what must hold true before considering the function outcomes as either success or failure, and include correct usage of `__verifier_old_uint` to compare to the contract's state before execution.
- **Handling Transfers**: Ensures zero-value transfers and self-transfers maintain state accurately, noting that for self-transfers the balance change effectively becomes a no-operation.

These annotations should properly facilitate verification of the contract’s compliance with the ERC20 standard and correct behavior under all specified conditions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:07:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

The verification errors indicate that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions might not always hold. It's crucial to structure these postconditions to explicitly account for success and failure paths, ensuring they cover every possible situation according to the ERC20 token standard.

Below is the updated smart contract with annotated postconditions for each function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || !success || msg.sender == _to
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */

    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || !success || _from == _to
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
    * If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- **`transfer` Function**: 
  - Postconditions now account for the non-self transfer scenario (`msg.sender != _to`) ensuring the amount is subtracted from the sender and added to the recipient upon success.
  - Covers both success and failure scenarios.

- **`transferFrom` Function**:
  - Same logic as `transfer`, but also accounts for the allowance reduction necessary when an authorization allows the transfer.
  - It separately handles the self-transfer (`_from == _to`) where balances should remain unchanged.

These annotations are formulated to respect the success, failure, and self-transfer pathways crucial for passing solc-verify checks and complying with the ERC20 standard.

To resolve the verification errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, let's carefully ensure the postconditions accurately describe the intended behavior considering success and failure paths and capture the required state changes, especially how the balances and allowances are managed.

Here’s a refined version with the necessary postcondition adjustments:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && msg.sender == _to) || (success && _value == 0)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && (success && _from != _to && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value)) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _from == _to) || (success && _value == 0)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
    * If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */

    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value) || !success

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Clarifications:
- **`transfer` Function**: 
  - The condition ensures transfers are effected only if sufficient balance is present and the transfer is successful.
  - Handles the condition for zero-value transfers while ensuring self-transfers (`msg.sender == _to`) do not affect balances.

- **`transferFrom` Function**:
  - Ensures that both the balance and allowance conditions are satisfied before executing transfers.
  - Properly accounts for self-transfers where the sender and receiver are the same, maintaining consistent balances.
  
These clarified postconditions are aligned with the ERC20 standard authentication routine and should assist effective verification.
