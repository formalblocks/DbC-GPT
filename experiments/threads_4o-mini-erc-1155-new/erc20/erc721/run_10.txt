=== USER [2025-04-16 10:45:56] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

To address the errors identified in the solc-verify analysis, let's ensure that the postconditions cover both successful and unsuccessful transactions, handle edge cases like no change in balances for self-transfers when `_value` is 0, and ensure allowances are correctly updated. Below is the corrected contract with refined postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions:

```solidity

    /**

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

In the corrected annotations:

- **Self-transfers**: Cases where the sender (`msg.sender` or `_from`) is the same as the recipient (`_to`) and for transactions with `_value == 0` are accounted for, ensuring no change in balance for these cases.
- **Error Scenarios**: Postconditions account for both successful and unsuccessful execution by using conditions that validate execution constraints (`!success`).
- **Allowance Updates**: For `transferFrom`, adjustments to allowances are only checked in successful cases.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 10:47:25] ===
The errors in the reasoning for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions point to an issue where the postconditions don't properly handle successful and unsuccessful transfers, particularly in cases where `_value == 0` is being transferred. We need to ensure that our postconditions properly account for all scenarios, including edge cases such as zero transfers and failures due to insufficient balance.

Here's an updated version of the contract with improved annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender])) || !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

In this updated version:

- **Self-transfers and balance constraints:** The postconditions capture the requirement that balances decrease from the sender and increase to the receiver in successful transfers, or remain unchanged in case of failures.
- **Authorization constraints:** Ensures that the allowance reductions for `transferFrom` are reflected correctly.
- **Zero value handling:** Although zero value transfers should be treated as normal transfers, the postconditions still account for this when ensuring that balances and allowances are updated correctly, whether success is true or false.

The refined postconditions are now more aligned with the expected behavior of token transfers involving zero values and potential rejection due to insufficient funds or authorizations.

Let's refine the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to address the concerns raised by the solc-verify tool. It appears that the existing postconditions might not be considering all the necessary states for invalid transactions ( where `_balances` should remain unchanged if success is false) or zero value transfers (where no change in balances should still meet the conditions).

Below is the updated contract with refined postconditions, ensuring we accurately handle both success and failure states:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;

    /**

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

Key adjustments:

- **Condition for balances:** Ensure balances only decrease upon successful transactions, reflected in cases of balance checks.
  
- **Account for self-transfers:** Special handling if the sender (`msg.sender`) is the same as the recipient (`_to`).
  
- **Handling of unsuccessful transfers:** For unsuccessful transfers (`!success`), balances should remain unchanged.

- **Zero Transfer Handling:** Appropriate conditions ensure that a `0` transfer doesn't wrongly affect balances.

These refinements directly target both successful and unsuccessful scenarios, ensuring balance and allowance states align appropriately with action outcomes per ERC20 standards.

The error messages indicate that there is an issue with using `==>` in the annotations, which is not a valid operator in the solc-verify tool's annotation language. Instead, we'll use logical conjunction (`&&`) to build conditions correctly and ensure postconditions are comprehensible and lead to clear verification paths.

Here is the corrected contract with appropriate postconditions for each function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

Here's a summary of the adjustments and their purposes:

- Use straightforward logical conjunction (`&&`) for conditions that must all be satisfied, removing the implication arrow (`==>`).

- Detailed coverage for successful and unsuccessful transactions through conditional balance checks.

- Consider special cases like self-transfers or zero value transfers and ensure the postconditions reflect proper state maintenance after any operation.

These adjustments ensure that each function's behavior per the ERC standard is well-represented and verifiable.

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:48:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

The errors that you're encountering indicate that the current postconditions need slight adjustments to ensure they correctly reflect the operation's expected outcomes per the ERC-20 specification. Let's refine the postconditions to address these errors and ensure successful and unsuccessful operations are handled appropriately.

Here's the refined contract with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

    /// @notice postcondition !success ==> (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]))
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Ensuring Precondition Validity:** Check if the preconditions (_balances checks) are maintained before successful operations proceed.
  
- **Capturing Resultant State for Success:** Use `success ==>` to show expected state changes when operations succeed, clarifying how balances should look post-operation.

- **Handle All Operation Scenarios:** Using logical structure to articulate how state reverts to its original form when operations fail (`!success`).

These refinements not only conform more closely to the ERC-20 standard by ensuring token transfers handle balance consistency on both successful and unsuccessful ends but also address issues causing errors in your formal verification.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 10:48:53] ===
The error messages from solc-verify reveal a misunderstanding of the syntax for specifying postconditions. Instead of using the implication operator (`==>`), we want to express logical conditions using `&&` and handle both success and failure cases using `||` appropriately.

Here's how you can correctly annotate the ERC20 smart contract functions with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender != _to && _value == 0) || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _to && _value == 0) || (msg.sender != _to) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender])) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to && _value == 0) || (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_from == _to && _value == 0) || (_from != _to && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender])) || !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Points:

- **Logical Conjunction (`&&`) and Disjunction (`||`):** Use these to combine scenarios and truth conditions that must all hold or at least one of them must hold to satisfy the specification correctly.
  
- **Consider Self-Transfers & Zero-Transfers:** For self-transfers, ensure no change in balance. For zero-transfers, ensure it's treated as a normal transfer with a fired event, but ultimately causing no change in balance.

- **Failed Transactions:** Appropriately indicate the state reversion in case of operation failure by ensuring pre-transfer balance conditions if `!success`.

These annotations clarify the expected functional behaviors while addressing the logical conditions for both success and failure cases comprehensively, aligning with ERC20's operational standards.

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:49:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Changes and Explanations

- **Zero Transfers:** They are included as valid operations, and the specification makes no explicit restriction to return false if `_value == 0`, so they must not affect balances but are still valid actions with postconditions when `success`.

- **Non-self Transfers vs. Self-Transfers:** Conditions differentiate cases when transfers are to another address vs. back to the sender.

- **Success and Failure Coverage:** Properly handle the resulting balances for both success and failure cases to eliminate situations where postconditions can be violated.

- **Logical Structure:** Ensures queries regarding balance, self-transfers, and resulting validity outcomes are clear with logical implications correctly managed with conjunction (`&&`).

This formulation provides a robust framework for checking postconditions consistent with ERC20 expectations and assumptions, adjusting according to valid actions, and expected logical results.

The error you're facing is due to the improper use of the implication operator (`==>`), which should not be used in solc-verify annotations. Instead, you should express the conditions using the correct logical operators. Let's revise the annotations to properly handle successful transfers, unsuccessful transfers, zero-value transfers, and self-transfers.

Here is the modified code with corrected annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender != _to) || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]))
    /// @notice postcondition (_value == 0) || (success && _balances[msg.sender] >= _value)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) || (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]))
    /// @notice postcondition (_value == 0) || (success && _balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Use of Logical Operators:** Instead of using `==>`, we utilize logical OR (`||`) and AND (`&&`) to express conditions that must hold for success or failure.
  
- **Balance Changes:** Postconditions assert balance subtraction for the sender and addition for the recipient, reflecting only if `success` is true.

- **Self-Transfers:** Ensure that nothing changes if the sender equals the recipient by keeping the same balance using `msg.sender == _to`.

- **Zero Value Transfers:** Ensure postconditions gracefully allow transfers where `_value` is 0 without altering balances.

These adjustments make sure the annotations are both syntactically correct and semantically aligned with the ERC-20 standard expectations for smart contract behavior.
