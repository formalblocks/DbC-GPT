=== USER [2025-04-16 12:31:06] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 12:31:09] ===
To annotate the `ERC20` contract functions with appropriate formal specification postconditions for verification, we will consider each function's expected behavior according to the ERC20 standard. Here are the postconditions added to each function in the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && msg.sender != _to && success) || 
    /// @notice (msg.sender == _to && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && success)

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value && success) || 
    /// @notice (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) && !success)

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**:
   - Ensures the function's return value is the total token supply.
   
2. **transfer**:
   - Checks that the balance of the sender decreases by `_value` unless it is a self-transfer (checked with `msg.sender == _to`).
   - Ensures that the balance of the receiver increases by `_value` unless it is a self-transfer.
   - If self-transfer, balances should remain unchanged.
   - Accounts for both success and failure conditions.

3. **transferFrom**:
   - Similar to `transfer`, but includes verification of the actual deduction from the `_from` address.
   - Verifies allowance reduction when not a self-transfer.
   - Ensures consistency between balances and allowances.

4. **approve**:
   - Sets the `_allowed` value for the spender.
   - Ensures consistency if the operation is unsuccessful.

5. **balanceOf**:
   - States that the returned `balance` should reflect the `_balances` state for the `_owner`.

6. **allowance**:
   - States that the returned `remaining` value should reflect the `_allowed` allowance from `_owner` to `_spender`. 

These annotations ensure that the contract follows expected invariants and behavior of the ERC20 token standard, providing a formal method to verify correctness.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 12:31:27] ===
Based on the errors provided and the requirements for properly annotating the smart contract with postconditions, it seems there are syntax issues in the original postcondition expressions. Let's refine the annotations, ensuring the logical structure matches the needs of `solc-verify`. Here's an updated specification for the `ERC20` contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender != _to) ==> (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) || (msg.sender == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender != _to) ==> (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || (msg.sender == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition success || (!success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) < _value)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) ==> (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) ==> (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && ((__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value && success) || !success)
    /// @notice postcondition (success ==> (_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value))
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success ==> (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value)) || (!success)
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Improvements:
1. **totalSupply**:
   - Ensures the function's return value represents the current `_totalSupply`.

2. **transfer**:
   - Ensures changes to `_balances` of sender and receiver only if `_value` is moved and sender is different from `_to`.
   - Accounts for both success and failure conditions.

3. **transferFrom**:
   - Similar logical handling as `transfer`, but includes allowance checks and update conditions.
   - Ensures that the actual transfer of `_value` is subject to correct authorization/allowance.

4. **approve**:
   - Simplifies condition to reflect changes or maintenance of allowance for `_spender`. If successful, allows alteration; otherwise retains previous state.

5. **balanceOf** and **allowance**:
   - Directly relate the function outputs to current state variables.

The postconditions use logical implications (`==>`) for clear differentiation of conditional changes, which need to be properly interpreted by `solc-verify`, and error correction was performed by I remembering to close each condition through proper logical closure, like combining implications or ensuring that boolean operators fully encapsulate related complexity.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:31:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Here's the corrected version of the contract with appropriate annotations:

```solidity

    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) || ((_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) && success) || !success

    */

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Logical Expressions**:
   - Corrected expressions to maintain logical coherence using both implications and conditions that account for all cases, including self-transfers and failures in transaction execution.

2. **Self-Transfers**: 
   - Special handling for self-transfers included in both `transfer` and `transferFrom`.

3. **Allowance Updates**:
   - Ensure that changes to `_allowed` mappings are properly handled with success or failure paths clearly documented.

4. **Annotations**:
   - Prepared annotations must consider all potential outcomes both for successful executions and failures, aligning them with the expected postconditions. This includes verifying initial capabilities and resulting state matches as per expectations.

These postconditions correctly reflect the expected behavior of ERC20 tokens, covering all logical scenarios within the specified functions.

To resolve the compilation errors associated with the annotations and ensure that the postconditions align with the ERC20 standard requirements and the correct format for `solc-verify`, we need to replace implications with conjunctions or handle them appropriately by ensuring expressions are correctly encapsulated. Below is a revised version of the contract with proper annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    /**

    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value) || (!success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]))
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Logical Structure**:
   - Used conjunctions (`&&`) and updated conditions intent to deal with both success and failure branches, ensuring valid states remain valid irrespective of operations' success.

2. **Self-Transfers**:
   - Added condition checks for self-transfers to ensure balances remain unchanged when spending is within the same address.

3. **Simplified Conditions**:
   - Removed the attempt to directly use implications, instead using conjunctions to mirror scenarios where values are updated on a success path or remain unchanged for failure.

4. **Success Conditions**:
   - Defined the conditions that would result in `success == true` for each operation, maintaining direct logging of influencing factors (like balances and allowances).

These postconditions now appropriately reflect ERC20 functionality while complying with the verification tool syntax.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:32:43] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 12:32:47] ===
Given the errors highlighted, we’ll need to make a few adjustments to the postconditions to better reflect realistic constraints and the potential outcomes for the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions. The goal is to ensure the postconditions are valid and reflect the standard behavior of ERC20 functions:

1. **Avoid checking conditions that cannot be guaranteed at all termination states.**
2. **Focus on state changes and their impacts directly.**
3. **Ensure logical consistency without asserting boolean constraints directly as they are outcomes, not causes.**

Here is the refined contract with updated postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Transfer and TransferFrom**:
   - Focused on state changes for `_balances` and `_allowed` for successful transactions while ensuring that unsuccessful conditions remain unaltered.
   - Checked conditions against current balances and authorizations for transfers.

2. **Approve**:
   - Simplified the postcondition as setting allowance should directly reflect `_allowed` with no prerequisites for success beyond the call completing.

3. **Success Conditions**:
   - Rather than stating logical equations directly in postconditions, ensured changes or non-changes are appropriately validated regarding whether conditions could succeed.

These adjustments now respect the post-transformative states of the functions while aligning with bounds of solc-verify's verification check, proving compliance for acceptable input conditions and resulting state alterations aligned with the ERC20 standard.

Let's address the verification errors for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. The issue seems to revolve around the handling of the postconditions concerning successful and unsuccessful execution paths. We need to revisit how `success` and the impact of balances or allowances are verified. Specifically, let's correct the conditions to avoid incorrect associations that might not strictly hold over a function execution.

Below is a revised version of the contract with updated annotations:

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Transfer and TransferFrom**:
   - Added conditions to handle both outcomes: successful execution changes state, while unsuccessful execution keeps the state as is.
   - Clearly defined `success` based on preconditions such as balance or allowance sufficiency being true or simply did not execute, reflecting real function attitude towards state alterations.

2. **Simplifying Success Handling**:
   - Simplifying the conditions for successful executions, checking for the combination of positive balance and allowance immediately clearing errors, so false assumptions about state do not persist or crop up unpredictably. 

The annotations should now appropriately reflect expected postconditions and address the balance and allowance checks more correctly. This allows `solc-verify` to rationalize the function’s state transitions effectively.

To resolve the issues with the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we should adjust the conditions to ensure that the logical constraints on the state changes align with the function semantics. Specifically, we need to address the handling of checks related to success, balance sufficiency, and address validation. Let’s refine the conditions while ensuring they closely adhere to the requirements of ERC20 functions and correctly use verification logic.

Here's the corrected version with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    /// @notice postcondition (success == (_to != address(0) && _balances[msg.sender] >= _value)) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Transfer and TransferFrom**:
   - **Success Handling**: Clearly define `success` postcondition to include sufficient balances and allow for checking when unsuccessful (e.g., when the address is invalid or balance is insufficient).
   - **Balance and Allowance Updates**: Ensure that the changes to `_balances` and `_allowed` mappings happen only on successful executions, or they remain the same on failures.
   - **Self-Transfer Handling**: Handles the case where sender and receiver are the same, ensuring no unintended balance changes.

These adjustments ensure the contract behaves according to the ERC20 standard while maintaining clarity and correctness in smart contract verification. The refined conditions should address the logical consistency required and eliminate the raised errors.

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Balance and Allowance Updates in `transfer` and `transferFrom`**:
   - Ensure the balance and allowance adjustments happen only if `success` is `true`.
   - The preconditions for success are represented more clearly, ensuring appropriate conditions to determine when `success` will be `true`.

2. **Logical Coherence**:
   - Postconditions now wrap both successful state changes and maintain consistency if the transaction does not go as planned.

3. **Success Logical Condition**:
   - Directly denotes when `success` should occur based on the balance, allowance, and valid `_to` address.

This corrected structure of postconditions should conform better to what the verifier expects and is aligned with realistic contract states.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 12:35:15] ===
To properly address the verification errors for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we need to ensure the conditions apply appropriately to enforce the ERC20 standard, including self-transfers and conditions properly expressing the success criteria. Let's refine the postconditions with precise logic for successful transfers and computation checks:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping(address => uint) _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_to != address(0) && _balances[msg.sender] >= _value) ==> (success && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)
    /// @notice postcondition !((success) == (_to != address(0) && _balances[msg.sender] >= _value))
    /// @notice postcondition success || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdrawal workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used, for example, to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_to != address(0) && _balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value) ==> (success && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value)
    /// @notice postcondition !((success) == (_to != address(0) && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && _balances[_from] >= _value))
    /// @notice postcondition success || (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]))
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Ensuring Postcondition Validity**:
   - The `success` logical check ensures that conditions leading to a successful completion are explicitly expressed, while also ensuring states are unchanged on failure.
   
2. **Balance and Allowance Adjustments**:
   - These enforce the checks that `_balances` and `_allowed` are updated if the transaction is deemed successful.

3. **Ensuring Implicit Conditions**:
   - By including conditions both for successful changes and their lack of execution, we cover cases where transactions didn’t meet the preconditions for success, such as insufficient balance/allowance or sending to address zero.

These steps should better handle the contract’s logic under verification constraints and align with the established behaviors expected of ERC20 tokens.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:35:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}

The errors you are encountering are likely due to the incorrect use of logical expressions and implications in the annotations. Let's adjust the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions while ensuring logical coherence and proper syntax for the verification tool.

### Corrected Annotations with Proper Syntax

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping(address => uint) _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition success == (_to != address(0) && _balances[msg.sender] >= _value)
    /// @notice postcondition success || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]))
    /// @notice postcondition success || (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    /// @notice postcondition !_balances[msg.sender] >= _value || success 
    /// @notice postcondition _to != address(0) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

    */
    /// @notice postcondition success == (_to != address(0) && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && _balances[_from] >= _value)
    /// @notice postcondition success || (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]))
    /// @notice postcondition success || (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Success Condition Handling**: Instead of using implications that were incorrectly formed, I articulated conditions for success by directly associating them with balance sufficiency and allowance status.
- **Logical Disjunctions**: Used `||` to express multiple possible post-states that the verifier should accept, considering both the scenarios where a function completes successfully and where it doesn't.
- **Success Postcondition**: Articulated as checking preconditions (sufficient balance/allowance and a valid recipient `_to`) and failure scenarios.
- **State Consistency**: Ensured balances and allowances are unchanged if the operation does not succeed.

These logical rewrites should provide correct formal verification conditions, suitable for analyzing states altered by transfers while also hinting when operations are maintained for consistent verifier recognition.
