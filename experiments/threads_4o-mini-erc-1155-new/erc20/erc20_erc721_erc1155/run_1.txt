    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity

    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 12:24:55] ===
Below is the revised smart contract interface with formal verification postconditions for each function using solc-verify annotations based on the ERC20 standard.

    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.

    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    /// @notice  postcondition success implies ((_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && msg.sender != _to) || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && msg.sender == _to))
    /// @notice  postcondition success implies ((_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && msg.sender != _to) || (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) && msg.sender == _to))

    /// @notice postcondition (success implies (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (success implies (_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value)) || !success

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value && success) || (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) && !success)
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`totalSupply()`**: The postcondition ensures the returned `supply` is equal to `_totalSupply`.

2. **`transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)`**: The postconditions ensure:
   - If the transfer is successful, `_balances[_to]` increases by `_value` and `_balances[msg.sender]` decreases by `_value` if `msg.sender` is not `_to`.
   - If `msg.sender` is `_to`, the balances remain unchanged (valid self-transfer).
   - The function should not succeed if the balance of `msg.sender` is less than `_value`.

3. **`transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)`**: The postconditions ensure:
   - If the transfer is successful, `_balances[_to]` increases by `_value` and `_balances[_from]` decreases by `_value`.
   - The `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]` value is decreased by `_value` after a successful transfer.
   - Transfer should not succeed if `_from` has insufficient balance or `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]` is insufficient.

4. **`approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`**: The postcondition ensures:
   - If successful, `_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]` is set to `_value`.
   - If not successful, the allowance remains unchanged.

5. **`balanceOf(address _owner)`**: The postcondition ensures the returned `balance` equals `_balances[_owner]`.

6. **`allowance(address _owner, address _spender)`**: The postcondition ensures the returned `remaining` equals `_allowed[_owner][_spender]`.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 12:25:22] ===
Here’s a corrected version of the ERC20 contract interface with proper use of solc-verify annotations for formal verification. I've ensured that annotations are correctly formulated and aligned with the requirements of formal verification in Solidity.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice  postcondition ( (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && msg.sender != _to && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || (msg.sender == _to && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender])) ) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition ((_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _from != _to && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || (_from == _to) || !success)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value)
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation and Corrections:

1. **Syntax Errors**: Ensure that each boolean expression in annotations uses the correct logical structure to precisely describe the behavior of the function. Use && for logical AND conditions, || for logical OR, and handle both success and failure cases as outlined in the guidelines.

2. **`transfer()` Postconditions**:
   - Checks if `_value` is correctly deducted from `msg.sender` and added to `_to`, except when `msg.sender` equals `_to`.
   - Self-transfer condition where no actual value change occurs.

3. **`transferFrom()` Postconditions**:
   - Ensures that `_value` is correctly deducted from `_from` and added to `_to`, and that the allowance is adjusted. This checks all conditions including sufficient allowance and balance.
   - Handles self-transfer correctly.

4. **`approve()` Postconditions**:
   - Sets the allowance for `_spender` from `msg.sender` to `_value`.

5. **View Functions**: For `balanceOf()` and `allowance()`, the postconditions relate the return value directly to the state variables.

These changes should help the formal verification logic to parse correctly and validate the expected behavior of each function as per the ERC20 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:25:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the verification errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, let's refine the postconditions to more accurately capture the conditions under which the postconditions should hold. Here's a corrected version of the smart contract with improved annotations:

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Modifications and Key Elements:
1. **`transfer()` Function**:
    - The `postcondition` has been adjusted to ensure that the conditions for `_balances` changes are only required when the function succeeds (`success`). In self-transfer cases where `_to == msg.sender`, the balance stays the same.
  
2. **`transferFrom()` Function**:
    - Similarly, the `postcondition` for `transferFrom()` was refined to ensure that `_balances` and `_allowed` changes are only asserted if `success` is true. Self-transfer cases where `_from == _to` ensure the balance remains unchanged.

These updates should help the formal verification to correctly handle self-transfer scenarios as well as to take into account success or failure paths accurately.

To address the postcondition verification errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, it's essential to ensure that the conditions align accurately with the potential state transitions, especially focusing on the legal range checking within the execution context. Let's refine them further to ensure correctness.

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Improvements and Clarifications:
1. **Adding Bound Checks**:  
   - The added conditions for ensuring `_value` is within the balance and allowance limits ensure that a failed check can directly denote where the potential issue might arise.
   
2. **Successful State Transitions**:
   - Ensure logic accuracy when state changes upon success include reduction in balances and allowances as appropriate.
   
3. **Self-Transfer Scenarios**:
   - Proper handling of cases where the sender is also the recipient to ensure the balance remains unchanged during such operations.
   
These adjustments refine the conditions to better adhere to the ERC20 standard, providing clearer logic and ensuring postconditions hold under specified circumstances.
