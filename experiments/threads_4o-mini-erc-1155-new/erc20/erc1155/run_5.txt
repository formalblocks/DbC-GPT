=== USER [2025-04-16 11:08:29] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

<eip>
## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 11:08:31] ===
To ensure the ERC20 contract complies with the EIP specification and to add formal verification conditions, we can annotate each function with appropriate postconditions using solc-verify syntax. Here's the annotated contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || _to == address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value)
    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender])) || (success == false)
    /// @notice postcondition msg.sender != _to || __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) == _balances[msg.sender]
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || _to == address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value)
    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender]) || (success == false)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **totalSupply**: Verifies that the returned supply is equal to the `_totalSupply`.

- **transfer**: 
  - Verifies that if the transfer is successful, the receiver's balance (`_balances[_to]`) is correctly updated with `_value`.
  - Verifies that the sender's balance decreases by `_value`.
  - Verifies that the transfer is unsuccessful if the sender does not have sufficient balance.
  - Handles self-transfers by ensuring sender's balance remains the same when `msg.sender == _to`.

- **transferFrom**: 
  - Similar to `transfer`, verifies the balance update for both `_from` and `_to`.
  - Verifies that for a successful transfer, the transferred value does not exceed the allowed limit for the `_from` account and the balance is enough.
  - Fires events for zero value transfers as well.

- **approve**: Verifies that the `_spender` is set an allowance of `_value` from `msg.sender`.

- **balanceOf**: Ensures the balance returned is equal to the actual `_balances` stored for `_owner`.

- **allowance**: Ensures the allowance remaining is equal to what is stored in `_allowed` for the `_owner` and `_spender`.

To address the verification errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we need to ensure that the postconditions comprehensively cover all execution pathways, including cases for different scenarios. Here's a revised version of the ERC20 contract with improved formal annotations:

```solidity

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Revisions:

- **transfer**: 
  - The postconditions handle the case when the sender is also the receiver (`msg.sender == _to`). The self-transfer case is explicitly addressed by ensuring no net change in the balance when both sender and receiver are the same.
  - Ensures that `_value` is deducted from the sender's balance and added to the receiver's unless they are the same.
  - Considers the case where the transfer can fail due to insufficient balance.

- **transferFrom**: 
  - Similar logic to `transfer` for handling self-transfers and ensuring the balance and allowance checks make the function fail if conditions are not met.
  - Verifies that the `_value` is deducted from `_from`'s balance and added to `_to`'s, accounting for self-transfers.
  - Makes sure that the function respects the bounds given by both the balance and the allowance.

The new annotations are aligned to ensure all edge cases are covered, especially self-transfers and authorization checks. This should address the verification issues noted in the previous version.

To address the verification error in the `transferFrom` function, we need to ensure that the postconditions fully capture the execution logic and possible outcomes, including scenarios where the function might fail due to authorization or balance issues. Below is the revised version of the ERC20 contract with improved formal annotations:

```solidity

```

### Explanation of Revisions:

- **transferFrom**: 
  - Includes postconditions to clarify behavior when `_from` equals `_to`, ensuring no change occurs in that case.
  - Ensures that for successful transactions, the `_value` is both deducted from `_from`'s balance and the allowance granted is reduced correctly.
  - Specifies the condition when `success` might be false, such as when `_value` is greater than the sender's balance or the approved allowance.
  - Provides allowance accounting which checks that the allowance is only adjusted on success.

With these adjustments, the postconditions are intended to comprehensively verify actual state changes under different scenarios in compliance with the ERC20 standard. This should address the error highlighted in the previous verification process.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:09:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To resolve the verification error in the `transferFrom` function, we need to fine-tune the postconditions to accurately reflect all possible execution paths, especially handling cases regarding allowance and balance simultaneously. Let's annotate the contract accordingly:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _to || (_balances[msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) && _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)))
    /// @notice postcondition _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) || (_from == _to && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]))
    /// @notice postcondition _from == _to || (_balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) && _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value))
    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender]) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || (!success && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]))
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **transferFrom**: 
  - Added a condition that correctly handles the allowance: it should only decrease if the transaction is successful.
  - Improved handling of balance and allowance checks along with the function's success status to clarify all cases—both when the transaction proceeds and when it doesn't.
  - Ensured that the postconditions fully describe both successful and unsuccessful cases, explicitly linking changes in allowances to transaction success.

These refinements are intended to better capture the desired behavior of the `transferFrom` function, achieving consistency with the standard specifications and resolving the noted verification error.

    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **transferFrom**:
  - Postcondition for self-transfers (`_from == _to`) ensures no state change in balances.
  - The condition `(_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender]) || !success` reflects that success requires both the balance and allowance sufficing.
  - Correctly captures scenarios with insufficient allowance or balance by adjusting the allowance only on successful transfers.
  
By ensuring the interplay of these conditions, the function should now uphold intended behavior under all permitted circumstances as specified by the ERC standard.

To rectify the verification error in the `transferFrom` function, we must ensure that the postconditions thoroughly account for all execution outcomes, particularly focusing on allowance and balance adequacies. Below are the refined annotations:

```

### Explanation:

- **transferFrom**:
  - Consistently maintains that both the balance of `_from` and `_to` are accurately updated post successful transfers.
  - Uses conditionals to ensure that only if `_value` is less or equal to both `_balances[_from]` and `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]` does the transfer succeed.
  - Correctly preserves the allowance, reducing it only on successful operations.
  - Includes negations for failure cases, specifically where an overflow on balance or insufficient allowance would prevent success.

By comprehensively detailing the conditions leading to both successful and unsuccessful executions, these annotations should fulfill the ERC20 standard expectations, resolving the verification error without over-restricting conditions.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To resolve the verification errors for the `transferFrom` function, let's refine the postconditions to ensure they capture the function's expected behavior comprehensively:

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **transferFrom**:
  - The postcondition checks are split to ensure that each critical condition (balance, allowance) independently leads to either success or failure.
  - The postcondition `_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) || !success` ensures the function fails if there is insufficient balance.
  - `_value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender] || !success` ensures that the allowance is respected.
  - Conditional statements confirm that on success, balances and allowances are adjusted; if unsuccessful, balances remain unchanged.
  
These adjustments strive to embrace the ERC20 standards thoroughly, capturing operational logic without absent conditions leading to potential contract misbehavior.

### Explanation:

- **transferFrom**:
  - Postconditions are more refined to ensure all possible pathways, especially involving approval and balance checks.
  - Ensures balances and allowances are adjusted correctly if successful.
  - Includes conditions for checks on balances and allowances needing to be sufficient for success, with appropriate logic for when the operation is unsuccessful.

By refining these conditions, we can more accurately capture the intended behavior per the ERC20 standard and verify it successfully. This should address the errors encountered.

Let's refine the solc-verify annotations to properly define the behavior of the ERC20 functions based on their expected performance and adhere to formal verification guidelines. Here are the updated annotations with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_to == msg.sender && success)
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender != _to && _balances[msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) && _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) && success)
    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && success) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_to == _from && success)
    /// @notice postcondition (_to != _from && _balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) && _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) && success)
    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender] && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value)) || (!success && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]))
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **transfer**:
  - Handles self-transfers explicitly by considering success in terms of no state change if `_to == msg.sender`.
  - Adjusts balances accordingly if there's a legitimate transfer to another address.
  - Ensures that there are adequate funds for the transfer to succeed, such that failure occurs only if conditions aren't met.

- **transferFrom**:
  - Captures similar logic for self-transfer and bounds on balance and allowance.
  - Ensures correct balance and allowance accounting for successful transactions or reverts.

These annotations aim to fully respect the intended logic while supporting formal verification methods, aligning tightly with the ERC20 standard and assisting in successful verification outcomes.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:12:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To address the verification issues for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, let's refine the postconditions to reflect the expected behavior, especially around self-transfer cases and balance/allowance checks. Here are the updated annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * Function SHOULD throw if the caller's balance doesn't have enough tokens to spend.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_to != msg.sender) || (_to == msg.sender && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender])) 
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && success) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * Function SHOULD throw unless the `_from` account has authorized the sender via some mechanism.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_to != _from) || (_to == _from && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]))
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender] && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || (!success && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]))
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
    * If called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

- **transfer**:
  - Handles self-transfer by ensuring the balance remains unchanged if `msg.sender == _to`.
  - Verifies balance update post-transfer if the transfer is successful.
  - Ensures that for the transfer to succeed, the sender must have enough balance.

- **transferFrom**:
  - Similar handling for self-transfers and correct update of balances.
  - Checks that the transfer only succeeds when both the balance and allowance conditions are met.
  - Ensures the allowance is decreased only if the transfer was successful.

These adjustments aim to meet specification expectations and adhere to the ERC standard, providing accurate postconditions for successful verification.
