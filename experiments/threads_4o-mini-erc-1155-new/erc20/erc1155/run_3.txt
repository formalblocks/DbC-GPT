    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

}
``` 

Each function has been annotated with formal postconditions that describe the expected changes or state of the contract. The conditions follow the ERC20 standard closely and ensure the correctness of the function implementations. For example, the `transfer` function checks the sender's balance, updates the balances upon success, and ensures the `Transfer` event is correctly fired, even for zero value transfers. Similar considerations apply for the other methods, ensuring compliance with the expected behavior delineated by the ERC20 specification.

Below is the corrected version of the smart contract interface with appropriate annotations using formal verification conditions for each function. I have addressed the issues related to the event invocation and Boolean operators.

    /**

    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Fixes Made:
1. **Emit Statement:** Added the `emit` keyword before the `Transfer` event call. This is necessary to correctly trigger events in Solidity.
2. **Postconditions Logic:** Fixed the Boolean expressions and ensured they adhered to logical constructs used in formal verification.
3. **Spelling Mistake:** Corrected `_success` to `success` where necessary in the context.

The updated contract now uses the correct syntax for emitting events and has well-defined postconditions consistent with the ERC20 standard. The checks for sufficient balance and allowance, as well as updates to balances, should now reflect the expected behavior correctly.

For successful verification annotations in Solidity and formal specifications, you don't include Solidity-specific statements (like `emit`) inside postconditions. Instead, the annotations should use logical assertions about state changes or event observances. Below is the corrected version:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */

    /**

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Corrections Made:
- **Event Assertions:** Removed any attempt to assert specific use of `emit` or event logs in postconditions. Verification focuses on logical assertions in mappings and balances.
- **Logical Assertions:** Improved logical consistency regarding allowance and balances in percipient self-referencing annotations.
- **Self-transfer Handling:** Included logical conditions to handle self-transfers effectively (`msg.sender == _to` and `_from == _to`).

This solution adheres to formal verification requirements, providing a robust basis for verifying the correctness of an ERC20 implementation using solc-verify annotations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:00:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

To address the verification errors for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we need to ensure the postconditions correctly represent all potential control flows, including unsuccessful executions where operations might revert or return `false`. It's crucial to handle balance and allowance checks carefully and establish appropriate preconditions where necessary. Let's refine the annotations for these two functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
- Added **preconditions** to ensure that `_value` is less than or equal to the relevant balances and allowed amounts, thereby clarifying the necessary conditions before performing the transfer.
- Clearly defined `success` return conditions by relating them to the relevant checks for balances and allowances.
- Ensured logical symmetry between the "view" functions and balance evaluations, maintaining consistency between `transfer` and `transferFrom`.

These changes aim to express the full range of behavior consistent with both success and failure outcomes, aligning with the ERC20 specification requirements. The success conditions in the postconditions focus concretely on ensuring all logical pathways are covered, providing more robust specifications suitable for formal verification.

```

### Corrections Made:

1. **Preconditions**: Added explicit preconditions to handle zero-value transfers and self-transfers, ensuring logical correctness and completeness. Preconditions are necessary since functions will throw if they can't meet the internal conditions.
  
2. **Success Handling**: Integrated explicit validation for both successful and unsuccessful transactions using postconditions, clearly differentiating whether functions can execute given their logical constraints.

3. **Balance Checks**: Improved balance and allowance validations to ensure that any state changes occur only if the requisite conditions (enough balance/allowance) allow them.

This refined approach aims to conform more strictly to the ERC20 spec by ensuring postconditions reflect logical outcomes for both formal verification and execution paths within the blockchain context.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

To address the verification errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we need to ensure the postconditions accurately represent both successful and unsuccessful execution paths, including validation of balance sufficiency for transfers. Let's enhance and refine these sections:

```solidity

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Zero-Value Transfers**: Explicitly handled zero-value conditions separately, ensuring logical correctness where `_value == 0` does not affect balances.
2. **Success Conditions**: Incorporated `success` conditions precisely, ensuring logical paths cover successful and unsuccessful attempts.
3. **Allowance & Balance Consistency**: Ensured correct decrementing of balances and allowances only when conditions allow, adequately reflecting post-conditions relevant to both success and failure.

These adjustments give a more accurate formal specification for the functions, enhancing consistency with the ERC20 standard and ensuring the verifier accounts for all logical outcomes.

In order to address the identified issues and ensure the postconditions align correctly with the ERC20 specification, we need to adjust the logical expressions for the success and state modification conditions in both the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. Here's the refined solution:

```solidity

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Considerations:

1. **Zero-Value Condition**: Explicitly allow for zero-value transfers, ensuring these result in success and fire the event without modifying balances.
2. **State Consistency**: Ensure balance updates are correctly tied to the conditions of having enough funds, modifying balances correctly only when those conditions are met.
3. **Success and Failure Paths**: Clearly delineate between successful conditions (where the balances update correctly) and failure paths that explicitly maintain postconditions with `!success`.

By ensuring these conditions, you align the interface closely with the expectations laid out by the ERC20 standard and the logical requirements necessary for formal verification.

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Balance and Allowance Verification**: Ensure that both the balance of the sender/owner (`_from` for `transferFrom`) and the allowance (in the case of `transferFrom`) are sufficient for execution to proceed on a successful path.

2. **Zero-Value Transfers**: Implement clean handling of zero-value transfers as successful executions that still meet postconditions.

3. **Clear Success/Failure Paths**: Establish distinct success and failure conditions so postconditions hold accurately, reflecting whether the state changes were applied.

Using these methods ensures postconditions capture all execution paths and transitions accurately in line with the ERC20 standard functionality.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the verification errors for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, it's important to ensure that postconditions are robustly defined in terms of state variables affected by the transactions and the conditions under which transactions can fail. The annotations must carefully handle zero-value transfers and the success/failure of transactions based on sufficiency of balances and allowances. Here is the corrected version:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /// @notice postcondition (success && (_value <= _balances[msg.sender])) || !success  // Ensures success only if the balance is sufficient
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Enhancements:
- **Zero-Value Transfers**: Handled separately to ensure they do not affect balances but still result in successful execution.
- **Postconditions for Balance Modifications**: Added conditions specifying that balance changes don't occur if `success` is `false`.
- **Allowance Updates**: Correctly handled allowance updates in postconditions when using `transferFrom`.
- **Success Conditions**: Clear demarcation of when operations succeed, ensuring functions don’t modify state unless preconditions (sufficient balance/allowance) are met.

With these changes, the conditions offer a comprehensive specification for the expected behavior per the ERC20 standard and align with the verifier requirements to appropriately handle all paths of execution.

Let's refine the postconditions of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to improve their correctness, particularly focusing on handling both successful and unsuccessful paths, including those involving zero-value transfers. Below are the updated annotations with added emphasis on the preconditions required for a successful operation:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && success) || !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with `_owner` address.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Considerations:

1. **Success and Failures**: Conditions for success require that sufficient balance and allowance exist. However, the verifier considers all branches, and thus the conditions for any possible outcome (both success and failure) are carefully outlined.

2. **Zero-Value Transfers**: Executed as normal transfers with the `Transfer` event firing, ensuring logical consistency even when `_value` is zero.

3. **State Changes**: When `success` evaluates to `true`, balances and allowances are updated accordingly, and logical consistency is given by associating changes directly with whether the function executed successfully.

These annotations now reflect a more accurate representation of the functions' intended behavior as specified by the ERC20 standard, while providing clear execution paths that can be verified.
