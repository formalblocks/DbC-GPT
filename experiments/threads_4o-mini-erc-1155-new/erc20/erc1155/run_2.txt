    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

This specification uses the `solc-verify` syntax to provide postconditions for each function. They ensure that the functions adhere to the expected behavior as specified in the ERC20 standard, including special cases such as zero-value transfers and approvals.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 10:55:19] ===
To address verification errors and ensure correct postconditions for the ERC20 contract, we need to carefully update the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. Furthermore, we should ensure our conditions are both adequate to capture intended functionality while also ensuring all cases, including transfers of zero value, self-transfers, and correct handling of unsuccessful attempts, are considered. Below is the updated contract annotation with corrected postconditions:

```solidity

```

### Key Adjustments:
- Special handling is provided for `_to != address(0)` to ensure valid address transfers.
- Conditions are designed to handle the special case of self-transfers (`msg.sender == _to` or `_from == _to`) correctly.
- Postconditions address both successful and unsuccessful operations, as required by the ERC specification.
- For `transfer` and `transferFrom`, adjustments ensure they handle changes correctly to `_balances` and `_allowed` mappings.

Based on the error messages you've provided, we need to adjust our postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to account for all scenarios correctly and resolve the verification errors. Let's update the contract with accurate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping(address => uint) _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Adjustments Made:
- For both `transfer` and `transferFrom`, the postconditions handle transfers to the same address (`_to == msg.sender` or `_to == _from`) effectively, allowing zero-value transfers to be valid while maintaining the invariant where no balance change is necessary.
- Maintained conditions to ensure the consistency of operations with previous state values using `__verifier_old_uint`.
- Covered edge cases for unsuccessful operations which involve zero value transfers.
- The conditions now more robustly check for proper balance and allowance management, ensuring any operation reduces balances and allowances appropriately within the constraints of allowed and sufficient balance checks.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.

        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

### Key Adjustments:
- Ensure that both `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions handle self-transfers without altering the balance.
- Check for non-zero transfers and successful conditions for balance reductions.
- Postconditions now properly consider both successful and unsuccessful outcomes (`success == true || false`).
- Adjust conditions for allowance change only on successful execution of `transferFrom`.
- Ensure balance invariance in the case of zero-value transfers or failed executions (for both sender and receiver in `transfer` and `from` and `to` in `transferFrom`).

To resolve the verification errors, we need more precise postconditions to ensure the ERC20 functions are operating correctly, especially focusing on the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. The issue seems to revolve around ensuring the `success` criteria align with ERC20 behavior and its checks on balances and allowances. Here's the updated contract with postconditions for verification:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    */

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - Check the balance decrement only when successful, ensuring abort on insufficient balance.
   - Ensure balance increase of `_to` only happens when `_to` is not `msg.sender` and is valid.

2. **transferFrom Function**:
   - Ensure allowance is reduced only on a successful transfer.
   - Ensure the function aborts unsuccessfully if there are insufficient balances or allowance.
   - Cover the edge case where `_value` is zero, handling it as a normal transfer.

This should help in accurately verifying each function against the ERC20 standard, handling the various conditional paths in execution.

To address the verification errors and warnings, let's ensure that the postconditions for `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and other functions handle all possible cases correctly and also utilize the correct variable names consistently. Here is a revised version of the contract with updated postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender != _to || _value == 0) || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value)
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _to) || (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition success == ((_balances[msg.sender] >= _value && _to != address(0)) || _value == 0)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to || _value == 0) || (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value)
    /// @notice postcondition (_from == _to) || (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || !success || _value == 0
    /// @notice postcondition success == ((_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && _to != address(0)) || _value == 0)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success == true
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- Correctly handle all edge and fail scenarios in `transfer` and `transferFrom`, ensuring balances and allowances are updated only when necessary.
- `success` must align with the function's intended conditions for successful execution (e.g., sufficient balances).
- Include self-transfer conditions by checking if `_from != _to` for `transferFrom` and `msg.sender != _to` for `transfer`.
- Ensure that `success` guards conditions that check reductions in balances and allowances, consistent with the ERC20 specification.

```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Transfer Function**:
  - Ensured balance decrement occurs only if the transfer is not a self-transfer (`msg.sender != _to`) and success criteria (sufficient balance) are met.
  - Considered that zero-value transfers should always succeed.

- **TransferFrom Function**:
  - Similar conditions to `transfer` regarding balance adjustments only on successful execution without self-transfer.
  - Checked allowance reduction for successful transactions only and ensured checks for zero value.

By making these adjustments, the verification process should better align with ERC20 specification assurances, ensuring robust handling of all expected scenarios.

### Key Adjustments:

- **Transfer Function**:
  - Ensures balance adjustment only if the transfer is successful, safeguarding against potential breaches in preconditions (e.g., if there isn't enough balance, it doesn't subtract).
  - Adds a check to allow zero-value transfers which always succeed; this reflects correct ERC20 behavior.
  
- **TransferFrom Function**:
  - Similar to `transfer`, ensures changes to balances and allowances occur only upon successful conditions.
  - Treats zero-value transfers correctly, reflecting that they should succeed and have no other balance or allowance impact.
  
By applying these conditions, we ensure that function behaviors align with both successful and unsuccessful outcomes, conforming to the behavior outlined in the ERC20 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the verification issues and ensure correct behavior according to the ERC20 specification, let's refine our postconditions to ensure they reflect the intended logic more clearly. Below is the revised contract with enhanced postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /// @notice postcondition success == ((_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && _to != address(0)) || _value == 0)

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Refined Conditions:
- **Transfer Function**:
  - Postconditions ensure the decrease in the sender's balance happens only with successful execution where the balance is sufficient.
  - Validates `_to` is not zero and allows zero-value transfers to be correctly handled as successful.

- **TransferFrom Function**:
  - Ensures the postconditions reflect balance and allowance reductions only occur when sufficient conditions are met.
  - Similarly, upholds checks against `_to` being zero and supports zero-value transfers correctly.

By these adjustments, we more accurately enforce the logic prescribed by the ERC20 standard and should fit the verification requirements. These conditions reflect the core essence of balance handling logic while maintaining comprehensive coverage to prevent unintended behavior.

### Explanation:

- **Transfer Function**:  
  - The postconditions ensure that if the transfer is successful (`success` is true), the sender's balance decreases by the `_value` and the recipient's balance increases by the `_value`.
  - It checks that the transaction is considered successful only if the sender has a sufficient balance, `_to` is a valid address, and `_value` is either non-zero or treated as a zero-value transfer.
  
- **TransferFrom Function**:  
  - Similar to `transfer`, it conditions that for a successful transfer, the `_from` account balance decreases, the `_to` account balance increases by the `_value`, and the `_allowed` mapping for the sender decreases by `_value`.
  - The transaction is successful if the conditions of sufficient balances and allowances are met, `_to` is valid, and accommodations for zero-value transfers are in place.

These refinements should minimize errors found during formal verification by ensuring that all noteworthy behaviors of the ERC20 standard are accounted for and that both success and failure scenarios are explicitly handled within postconditions.
