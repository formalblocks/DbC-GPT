=== USER [2025-04-16 11:21:29] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

Here, I've added formal verification postconditions for each function based on the ERC20 specification:

- **totalSupply**: The total supply is returned correctly.
- **transfer**: On success, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by the `_value`, and there is enough balance. Also, checks that zero address isn't used.
- **transferFrom**: Similar to transfer, but also checks that the allowance is properly used and updated.
- **approve**: Sets the allowance correctly and allows overwriting.
- **balanceOf**: Returns the balance correctly.
- **allowance**: Returns the correct allowance amount.

```

I made adjustments to the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. Here's an explanation for each postcondition added:

1. **transfer**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - If `msg.sender` and `_to` are the same, the balance should remain unchanged upon successful transfer (self-transfer handling).
   - If the transfer is successful and `msg.sender` and `_to` are different, the sender's balance should decrease, and the receiver's balance should increase.
   - Considers both the success and failure scenarios, ensuring account balance is checked for sufficiency.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Reflects similar conditions as `transfer`, but also checks that the allowance is respected.
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - If `_from` and `_to` are different and the transfer is successful, check balances and allowance correctly.
   - If transferring to the same address (self-transfer), the balance remains unchanged.
   - Considers scenarios to ensure that balances and allowances update correctly with success, or checks preconditions in case of failure.

These conditions should help model the expected behavior according to the ERC20 standard while addressing the verifier's previous concerns.

}
```

### Key Changes and Justifications:

- **transfer**: Ensures either the balances update correctly on a successful transfer or that conditions are maintained on a failed transaction. Checks for self-transfer to ensure balances remain the same. Confirms that the balance decrease must be possible given the `_value`.

- **transferFrom**: Similar handling as the `transfer` function but includes checks for allowances. Validates that if the transfer is successful, allowances decrease, and balances update correctly, or preconditions for failure are maintained.

These annotations incorporate the condition handling for failure (`|| !success`) and self-transfers, addressing potential pitfalls shown by the verifier errors. Additionally, both functions check that transferring zero `_value` is possible regardless of other state conditions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:23:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:

1. **transfer**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Checks sufficiency of the sender's balance for a successful transfer.
   - Handles potential for zero-value transfers.
   - Covers cases for successful execution where sender and receiver are different, adjusting balances accordingly, including self-transfer scenario.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Validates that both balance and allowance requirements are met prior to successful execution.
   - Handles potential for zero-value transfers.
   - Ensures proper balance and allowance decrement for successful transfers, accounting for self-transfers where balances remain unchanged.

These changes add checks to cover all logical pathways as defined in the ERC standard, while maintaining consistency across the operations of transfer and transferFrom.

### Explanation:

1. **transfer**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Introduces a condition `success == (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value && _to != address(0))` to ensure success is directly related to preconditions being satisfied.
   - Handles self-transfers (where `msg.sender == _to`), maintaining balance invariant.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Similarly introduces `success == (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && _to != address(0))`.
   - Considers both successful and self-transfer cases.

These adjustments streamline the checks for conditions that allow success, ensuring `_to` is not zero, and covering zero-value transfers explicitly. The specification now relates directly to whether the operation is allowed to succeed, addressing possible verification errors.

### Explanation:

1. **transfer**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Checks that if the transfer is successful, the sender's `_balances` decreases by `_value` and the recipient's `_balances` increases by `_value`.
   - Verifies that the sender's balance was initially greater than or equal to `_value` to allow for success.
   - Pre-checks must meet the condition for the function not to throw, captured by `(success && _balances[msg.sender] >= _value) || !success`.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Verifies that if the transfer is successful, the `_from` address has its balance decreased by `_value`, and `_to` has its balance increased by `_value`.
   - Checks that the allowance of the sender is reduced by `_value`.
   - Checks that both the balance of `_from` and the allowance from `_from` for the msg.sender are sufficient to cover `_value` for success.

These annotations aim to ensure that each execution path for `transfer` and `transferFrom` is logically sound and consistent with the required conditions for safe token transfers, according to the ERC20 standard, while handling both success and failure cases.

### Explanation:

1. **transfer**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Verifies that if the transfer is not successful, the preconditions (like having enough balance) weren't met or an exception should have been triggered.
   - The postcondition ensures that transfers reflect correctly for both scenarios: successful or unsuccessful.
   - Includes self-transfer condition to maintain the invariant.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Reflects that if a transfer fails, it's due to insufficient balance or allowance.
   - Postconditions ensure that both the balance deduction and allowance deduction are properly handled for successful transfers.
   - Handles self-transfer to ensure balances remain consistent.

This approach directly addresses failure cases by verifying the conditions required for success before deductions in every transaction's pre-state, which should address the verification issues identified in the previous runs.

   - Verifies that if the transfer is successful, the postconditions of balances decreasing and increasing correctly hold. The message sender’s balance should reduce and the recipient’s balance should increase.
   - Covers the case for self-transfers where no balance change occurs.
   - The `success` postcondition matches the expected condition that must hold for a successful transaction.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Similar checks for ensuring no zero address transfer.
   - Verifies all balance and allowance changes match expectations if the transfer is successful.
   - Ensures that both the balance of `_from` and the allowance are decremented if transfer conditions are met.
   - Handles self-transfers similarly to `transfer`.

These postconditions should correctly align the expectations from both a functional perspective and address the requirements needed by solc-verify.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

### Explanation:

1. **transfer**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Checks preconditions ensure enough balance and that the function is likely to demonstrate the correct logic paths during verification tests (`|| !success` handles unsuccessful cases).
   - Clarifies that the success condition correctly involves both balance sufficiency and the target not being a zero address.
   - Accounts for the special condition when `msg.sender` and `_to` are the same for self-transfers.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Similar to `transfer` with additional allowance checks.
   - Ensures sufficient allowance and balance for successful execution; likely success conditions are explicitly tied to these preconditions.
   - Handles both self-transfers and normal transfers, covering all logical execution paths as specified by ERC20.

This should enhance the formal model to clearly define both the success criteria and the postconditions across various transaction scenarios for `transfer` and `transferFrom`.

### Explanation:

1. **transfer**:
   - Validates that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Checks that there is enough balance for the transaction to succeed (`_balances[msg.sender] >= _value`).
   - Ensures that if the transaction is successful, the balances adjust appropriately, with special cases handling self-transfers.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Confirms both the balance and the allowance are sufficient for a successful transfer.
   - Includes logic to handle cases where the sender and recipient are the same, ensuring no balance changes during self-transfers. 

Both functions are designed to mirror the expectations in ERC20, where all transactions either update accordingly or remain unaffected in cases where preconditions aren't met, indicated by `|| !success`. This also incorporates self-transfer edge case handling.
