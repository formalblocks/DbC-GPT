=== USER [2025-04-16 12:08:32] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

In this annotated ERC20 contract, each function has been given formal postconditions using the solc-verify syntax:

- **`totalSupply()`**: Ensures that the return value reflects the current `_totalSupply`.
- **`transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)`**:
  - Ensures that if the transfer succeeds, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`, provided `_to` is not the sender to handle self-transfer logic separately.
  - Accounts for zero-value transfers as legitimate actions without affecting balances, especially for self-transfers.
- **`transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value)`**:
  - Similar to `transfer`, but also decreases the allowance by `_value` when the transfer is successful. It handles the reduction of allowance and correctly adjusts balances for `_from` and `_to`.
  - Also handles zero-value, same address transfers separately.
- **`approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`**: Verifies that the allowance is set to `_value` successfully.
- **`balanceOf(address _owner)`**: Ensures the return value matches the balance stored in `_balances`.
- **`allowance(address _owner, address _spender)`**: Ensures the return value matches the allowance stored in `_allowed`.

These postconditions accurately depict the behavior of the ERC20 functions and maintain consistency with the ERC20 standard specification.

```

### Explanation:

- **`transfer` Postconditions**: Postconditions were changed to handle zero-value transfers as no state change in balances. It explicitly states that if `_to` is not the sender, balances should adjust accordingly, otherwise, for zero transfers, no changes occur.
  
- **`transferFrom` Postconditions**: Similar adjustments are made, addressing both the allowance impact and balance adjustments correctly. This also ensures `transferFrom` only modifies balances and allowances on a successful transfer and acknowledges zero-value transfers equivalently.

This revision ensures postconditions honor the state transitions accurately for typical and edge case scenarios.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

```

### Key Points:

- **`transfer` Postconditions**:
  - Ensure that both success and failure cases are correctly handled.  
  - Handle self-transfers as an ordinary process without balance changes.
  
- **`transferFrom` Postconditions**:
  - Consider all transfer conditions with appropriate state updates, or no change if unsuccessful.
  - Recognize that authorization (via allowance) must be decremented on success.

By assuming all edge cases (like zero-value transactions and self-transfers) operate normally, the potential postcondition errors are mitigated to reflect the expected ERC20 token behavior correctly.

### Key Adjustments:

- **`transfer`**:
  - First, handle zero-value transfers where both balances should stay unchanged and confirm that transfers trigger as normal events.
  - Handle successful non-zero transfers by ensuring balance deduction from the sender (only if `_to` is not the sender) and addition to the `_to`.
  - Ensure failure results in balances remaining the same.

- **`transferFrom`**:
  - Enforce that zero-value transfers maintain balances and allowance unmodified.
  - In successful non-zero transfers, handle balance shifts and allowance reduction.
  - Ensure that any transfer failure leaves state unchanged for balances and allowance.

These conditions aim to thoroughly cover possible execution paths, ensuring that the logic reflects ERC20 standard principles reliably.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 12:10:27] ===
To refine the smart contract's annotations and accommodate all verification errors, we need to ensure our postconditions are robust for every possible scenario outlined by the ERC20 standard. This includes handling zero-value transfers, self-transfers, valid transfers, and ensuring no state change upon failed operations.

Let's correct and enhance the postcondition annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping(address => uint) _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to` and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value >= 0 && _to != msg.sender && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) 
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value == 0 && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender])) 
    /// @notice postcondition (!success && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to` and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value >= 0 && _from != _to && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) 
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value == 0 && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]))
    /// @notice postcondition (!success && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]))
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value) || (!success && _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]))
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Zero Value Transfers**: Clear handling to ensure state invariance under zero-value transfers, doing so for both success and failure.
- **Non-Self Transfers**: Properly reflect changes in balances when transfers are not self-transfers and succeed.
- **Failure Handling**: Retain the invariant condition that balances or allowances do not change if an operation is unsuccessful.

These modifications deliver postconditions that satisfy the contractual behaviors expected in any ERC20-compliant implementation.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:10:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To resolve the verification errors and ensure that all edge cases are adequately handled, we need to adjust our postconditions for potential issues in state changes, especially focusing on scenarios of self-transfer and zero-value transfers. Let's enhance the postconditions to make all scenarios explicit:

```solidity

    */

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Self-Transfers**: Included conditions ensuring the behavior for `_to == msg.sender`, treating them as no-ops except for zero-value transfers.

- **Zero-Value Transfers**: Confirmed that zero-value transfers treat balances as unchanged but recognized for event purposes.

- **Consistency in Failure Behavior**: Clearly outlined no state change should occur upon failures across the board, ensuring consistency between `transfer` and `transferFrom`.

- **Handling Non-Self Transfers**: Ensures valid deductions and credit for successful non-self transfers.

These refinements should address all practical scenarios emphasized by the ERC20 behavior specification.

- **Zero-Value Handling**: Clearly defined that zero-value transactions are viewed as successful transfers with no balance change.
- **Consistency With Allowance**: Considered allowance adjustments in `transferFrom`.
- **State Invariance on Failure**: Ensured that balances and allowances remain unchanged if the transaction does not proceed.

The refactoring leads to appropriately detailed postconditions to verify correct and consistent state transitions, addressing the sources of verification errors effectively.

### Explanation:

- **`transfer` Operation**:
  - Postconditions accommodate zero-value transfers, ensuring no balance change.
  - Includes handling for cases when sender and receiver are the same.
  - Ensures changes in the state are faithful to successful transfers and zero if unsuccessful.

- **`transferFrom` Operation**:
  - Similar consideration for zero-value transfers, allowances, and maintaining proper balance and allowance adjustments in both successful and unsuccessful scenarios.

The specified postconditions provide a complete outline of all possible states, covering standard cases and exceptions efficiently according to the ERC20 standard.

### Key Adjustments:

- **Handling Zero-Value Transfers**:
  - Ensured that zero-value transfers are treated as successful operations without changes in balances.
  - Handled the case explicitly where zero-value occurs with self-transfers (sender is the receiver).

- **General State Transitions**:
  - Clearly defined balance changes for transfers and `transferFrom` that are not zero or for the same account.
  - Added clear conditions to account for changes in allowances for `transferFrom`.

Each postcondition should now more precisely capture the behavior when a transaction is successful or unsuccessful, and reflect changes under all defined logical cases as specified in the ERC20 standard.

### Explanation:

- **Zero-Value Handling**: Ensures zero-value transfers behave correctly, affirming no net effect when `msg.sender == _to`.
- **Self-Transfers**: Explicitly handled showing no net effect when `_from` equals `_to`.
- **General Transfers**: Conditions for successful transfers where `_value > 0`, updating balances and allowances correctly.
- **Failure Handling**: States stay unchanged when transfers or operations are unsuccessful.

The conditions should greatly improve alignment with the ERC20 standard, correctly reflecting valid checks and results to satisfy verifier expectations.
