=== USER [2025-04-16 11:53:25] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition asserts that the returned `supply` is equal to the `_totalSupply`. 

2. **transfer**: 
   The postcondition handles success and failure: upon success, it ensures the balance change from sender to receiver with tokens transferred correctly and also handles the self-transfer case by asserting the balance invariant for zero value transfers. The condition handles both scenarios: if the transfer is successful or not.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   Similar to the `transfer` function but also decreases the `_allowed` balance. It checks if the conditions hold upon success or otherwise. This includes verifying the invariant when the `from` address is the same as the `to`, with zero value transfers.

4. **approve**: 
   The postcondition sets the `_allowed` mapping to be exactly `_value` for the `_spender` as per the ERC20 standard.

5. **balanceOf**: 
   The postcondition defines the returned `balance` to be the actual balance of the account from `_balances`.

6. **allowance**:
   The postcondition ensures that the returned `remaining` matches the current allowance from `_allowed`. 

### Remarks
- Consistency in handling transfers of zero values ensures that events are fired correctly as per ERC20 documentation.
- Preconditions for balance and approval changes are indirectly checked using postconditions related to state variables and function parameters/return values, adhering to a typical usage pattern in formal verification.

### Explanation of Changes

1. **transfer**:
   - Adjusted the postcondition to handle both success and failure cases more explicitly. If the transfer is unsuccessful, the balances remain unchanged. 
   - Also, ensured that cases where the sender transfers to themselves are handled correctly by checking if `msg.sender == _to`.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Similar handling for success and failure as in `transfer`, with additional conditions for the `_allowed` changes.
   - If the operation is unsuccessful, the balances and allowance remain unchanged.

This version should more accurately reflect the intended logic and constraints of ERC20 transactions, accommodating possible failure paths and self-transfers appropriately.

### Explanation of Changes

1. **transfer**:
   - Updated the postcondition to ensure that self-transfer with value `0` is treated as a successful operation, maintaining balance invariants.
   - If the transfer is not successful, both the sender's and receiver's balances remain unchanged.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Similar update as in `transfer`, verifying successful operations for both transfers and self-transfers with zero value.
   - If not successful, the balances and allowance remain unchanged.

These adjustments make sure that special cases such as self-transfers, particularly with zero values, adhere to the expected conditions while maintaining consistency and correctness across both functions.

### Explanation of Adjusted Postconditions

1. **transfer**:
   - Refined the condition to handle both changes in `msg.sender` and `_to` balances only in the case of success.
   - Specifically added a condition to handle zero-value self-transfers always succeeding without changing balances.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Updated conditions to ensure that balances and allowances are correctly adjusted only upon success.
   - Included a condition for zero-value transfers, ensuring success when `_from` and `_to` are the same without affecting balances.

These refinements address previous issues by ensuring postconditions reflect all expected token transfer scenarios, including transfers to oneself irrespective of the value.

### Key Adjustments

1. **transfer**:
   - Clarified that on successful completion the balances are updated correctly when not self-transferring.
   - Explicitly state that a self-transfer (`msg.sender == _to`) should still succeed as per standard, maintaining balance.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensured that on successful completion, both the transferring balances and decreasing allowance reflect correctly.
   - Included a check for self-transfers (`_from == _to`) ensuring it registers as a successful operation even if no balance change is needed.

With these adjustments, the verifier should be able to correctly validate the consistency and correctness of ERC20 behaviors for these functions.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To ensure consistent behavior according to the ERC20 standard and address the verification errors, we'll split the postconditioning more clearly into success and failure outcomes, focusing especially on ensuring self-transfers are handled correctly. Here are the annotations you can add:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Considerations

1. **Transfer and TransferFrom**: 
   - Both functions have conditions checking for self-transfer cases where the sender is also the recipient, asserting that balances remain unchanged if they succeed.
   - Ensuring the change in allowances in `transferFrom` is reflected appropriately only when successful.

2. **Success and Failure**:
   - Each postcondition for successful functions checks for proper deduction and addition of token balances along with adjustments to allowances (where applicable).
   - Failures ensure that the state (balances and allowances) remain unchanged.

By accommodating these requirements, the postconditions now provide robust logic-mirroring for the intended outcomes of the ERC20 token functions, offering alignment with both correctness and the standard’s expectations.

Let's refine the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to accurately capture the expected behavior according to the ERC20 standard and address the verification errors noted. Here is the annotated smart contract:

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments

1. **Self-Transfer**:
   - If `_from` or `msg.sender` is equal to `_to`, it is treated as a successful operation (`success`) without affecting balances, since no actual movement happens.

2. **Success and Failure Conditions**:
   - On successful transactions (not self-transfers), the balances are updated according to the transfer and the allowance is adjusted for `transferFrom`.
   - On failure, all balances and allowances remain unchanged.

These changes should help ensure that the contract's behavior is accurately specified and verifiable, capturing expected functionality as per the ERC20 standard.
