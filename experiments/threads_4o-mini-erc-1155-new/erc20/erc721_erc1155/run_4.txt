=== USER [2025-04-16 11:56:43] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation
- **`totalSupply`**: Simply checks that the returned `supply` is equal to the `_totalSupply`.
- **`transfer`**: 
  - Ensures that if `_value` is transferred (not zero and not a self-transfer), the balances update accordingly, i.e., sender's balance decreases, `_to`'s balance increases.
  - Includes a check to handle self-transfers correctly (`msg.sender == _to`).
- **`transferFrom`**: 
  - Similar to `transfer`, but also checks and updates allowances.
- **`approve`**: 
  - Sets `_allowed` for `_spender` to the `_value`.
- **`balanceOf`**: Returns the balance attributed to `_owner`.
- **`allowance`**: Returns the allowance remaining for `_spender` from `_owner`.

    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- **Transfer Function**:
  - Used implication (`==>`) to address the conditions for different cases such as when `_value` is zero or the same address is a self-transfer.
  - Ensures that if the `transfer` call was successful, then the requisite conditions on balances and account state changes are met.

- **TransferFrom Function**:
  - Logical checks ensure that allowed and balance constraints verify the capability of the `transferFrom` operation.
  - Ensuring allowances are correctly managed during a successful `transferFrom`.

- **Removed invalid postcondition logic** by replacing it with multi-case logic that applies accurately to different states and arguments passed to the function.

Feel free to adapt and extend this annotation style to other contracts where necessary.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 11:57:51] ===
Let's address the errors and adjust the postconditions so that they meet the requirements of the `solc-verify` tool. Errors in annotations typically result from syntax errors or the use of inappropriate logical operators. I'll adjust the logical implications in the postconditions using valid logical expressions.

Here's the corrected version of the smart contract with formal verification conditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value && (_to != msg.sender || _value == 0)) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) || !success || _value == 0
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success || _value == 0
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value && (_from != _to || _value == 0)) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) || !success || _value == 0
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success || _value == 0
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Changes:
- **Logical Expressions**: Used conditional logic expressions directly without misapplying logical implication (`==>` which isn't interpreted correctly in certain syntax environments), instead using valid logical operations inside postconditions.
  
- **Transfer and Allowance Constraints**: Postconditions now ensure the constraints are put in place for pre-transfer between different accounts, using the exact mapping parameters and existing state checks.

This should help the annotations pass the `solc-verify` checks correctly. Adjustments were made to logical expressions to ensure valid syntax within conditional postconditions.

Here's the revised contract with modified annotations:

    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **`transfer` Function**:
  - Revised postconditions ensure that: if successful, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`.
  - Included an annotation for the case where `_to` is the same as the sender and `_value` is zero.

- **`transferFrom` Function**:
  - Consistently handles withdrawal and allowance updates, ensuring correct logic paths reflecting the balance transfer conditions.
  - Postconditions check for correct allowance decrement and balance updates only if the transaction is successful and `_value` is greater than zero.

The verified changes should align better with the `solc-verify` expectations and accurately represent the intended logic of an ERC-20 token as per the standard. Adjust any remaining issues based on real implementation and standards documentation if required.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 11:58:39] ===
It seems like there was a misunderstanding with the syntax required for expressing conditional semantics in postconditions. Let's modify the annotations to meet the `solc-verify` parser's requirements while ensuring they capture the correct contract logic as specified by the ERC-20 standard.

Here's the updated contract with revised postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _to || _value == 0) ? (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to])) : true
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_from == _to || _value == 0) ? (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to])) : true
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Conditional Expressions**: Used the ternary conditional operator `condition ? true_case : false_case` for handling self-transfer (when sender is the same as receiver) and zero-value transfer cases. This form ensures the postcondition is always valid and avoids syntax errors.

- **Logical consistency across functions**: Ensures the postconditions accurately verify the expected balance and allowance changes only for successful operations, and maintains state otherwise.

By adopting these specific expressions, the annotations should comply better with the `solc-verify` tool syntax requirements.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:59:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To resolve the verification errors, let's carefully adjust the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. Specifically, we'll ensure that conditions for successful execution are clearly defined, and we'll manage possible failure scenarios too.

Here's how we can revise the annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping(address => uint) _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value && msg.sender != _to) ==> (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value && msg.sender == _to) ==> (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]))
    /// @notice postcondition !success ==> (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value

    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **`transfer` Function**:
  - Differentiate between when a successful transfer actually changes balances based on whether or not `_from` is equal to `_to`.
  - Consider failure conditions where balances remain unchanged.

- **`transferFrom` Function**:
  - Include additional logic for consistency when `_from` equals `_to`.
  - Failure conditions confirm no changes to balances or allowances.

These adjustments strive to ensure precise alignment of postconditions with the intended function semantics and address the issues found in verification.

To address the errors and annotate the contract correctly, let's adjust the postconditions to ensure they comply with the `solc-verify` syntax and requirements. The errors suggest issues with using logical implications directly. Instead, let's clearly break down success and failure conditions without using implication directly.

Here’s the revised contract with the corrected annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value && msg.sender != _to) ? (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) : (msg.sender == _to || _value == 0) ? (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender])) : !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value && _from != _to) ? (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) : (_from == _to || _value == 0) ? (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender])) : !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Logical Conditions**: Used conditional operator `(condition) ? (true_case) : (false_case)` to evaluate both cases leading to correct assertions and finalize the postconditions correctly.
  
- **Clear Success/Failure Paths**: Ensures that the state changes only reflect successful operations and remains unchanged in failure scenarios.

- **Break Down Complex Logic**: Postconditions handle cases of self-transfers separately and consider scenarios where operation success cannot happen due to insufficient balances or other reasons.

These modifications ensure the annotations remain within the bounds of the allowed syntax and adhere more closely to the ERC-20 behavior expectations.

Let's address the verification error in the `transferFrom` function. This might be a result of overly complex postconditions. We'll simplify them for clarity while ensuring correctness according to the ERC-20 specification. The complexity often arises from trying to ensure that the function captures all possible states.

Here's the updated contract with revised postconditions for `transferFrom`:

```solidity

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- For `transferFrom`, revised the initial complex condition to ensure clarity: if successful, ensure balances and allowances are correctly adjusted.
- Handle both when the transaction is a self-transfer or if `_value` is zero, ensuring it does not alter balances incorrectly.
- Simplified handling ensures that postconditions are easy to follow and directly relate to possible transaction states.

This should resolve the verification issues by appropriately reflecting the possible contract's state changes.

To resolve the error in the `transferFrom` function, we need to ensure that postconditions correctly handle the result of a transfer, whether successful or not. Let's break down successful and unsuccessful transactions in a more granular manner to avoid potential pitfalls in verification assumptions.

### Key Adjustments:

- **`transferFrom` Clarification**:
  - Separated out self-transfer logic to ensure no changes occur despite success.
  - More granular success and failure paths to address potential condition overlaps or verification inaccuracies.
  
- **Postconditions**:
  - Clear distinctions between conditions for successful and unsuccessful outcomes for better verification coverage.

This setup should pass verification by maintaining logical separation of success conditions and ensuring that operations correctly adjust balances and allowances.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 12:00:45] ===
To address the verification errors in the `transferFrom` function, let's ensure that postconditions clearly distinguish between successful and unsuccessful transactions while keeping the logic simple and adhering to the ERC-20 specification.

We'll also ensure that any self-transfer logic and zero-value transfer logic is handled correctly.

Here is the updated contract with revised postconditions for the `transferFrom` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping(address => uint) _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value && msg.sender != _to && _value > 0) ? (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) : (!success || (msg.sender == _to || _value == 0) && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value && _from != _to && _value > 0) ? (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) : (!success || (_from == _to || _value == 0) && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]))
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again, it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Clear Success/Fall-Through Logic**: Now fails explicitly (`!success`) when constraints for value, allowance, and balance are not satisfied.
  
- **Self-Transfer and Zero-Value Handling**: Thoroughly ensures those cases do not inadvertently modify balances or allowances, preserving the current state.

With these changes, the annotations should provide the correct logical resolution paths and help `solc-verify` verify them effectively.
