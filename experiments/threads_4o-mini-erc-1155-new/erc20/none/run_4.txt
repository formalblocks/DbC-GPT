    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

### Explanation:

1. **totalSupply**:
   - That the returned `supply` is equal to the `_totalSupply`.
   
2. **transfer**:
   - Ensures that when the function is successful, the sender’s balance decreases by `_value` and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`.
   - The sender’s balance should not become negative.
   - `success` is true only if the sender's balance is sufficient or the sender is transferring to himself.

3. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures that when the function is successful, `_value` is subtracted from `_from`'s balance and added to `_to`'s balance.
   - The allowance `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]` is decreased by `_value`, ensuring that either the allowance was sufficient or the transaction fails.
   - `success` is true only if both the balance and allowed balance are sufficient.

4. **approve**:
   - Guarantees that the `_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]` is set to `_value` after execution.
   - Always successful, hence `success`.

5. **balanceOf**:
   - The function returns the balance of the specified address `_owner` which equals `_balances[_owner]`.

6. **allowance**:
   - The function returns the allowance for `_spender` from `_owner` which equals `_allowed[_owner][_spender]`. 

These annotations ensure that the smart contract functions adhere to the expected behaviors as specified by the ERC-20 standard and enable formal verification of their properties.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 09:27:02] ===
To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions take into account all possible paths through the functions. Specifically, the errors in `transfer` and `transferFrom` suggest that there might be paths where the postconditions related to balance changes and success criteria are not holding. We need to adjust the postconditions accordingly.

Here is the revised contract with added postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **transfer**:
  - When `_to` equals `msg.sender`, no transfer occurs, the balances remain unchanged, and `success` is true. 
  - Added a condition for the case when the transfer `_value` is zero or greater than `msg.sender`'s balance, leading to `success` equals false.
  
- **transferFrom**:
  - Ensures that if the function succeeds (i.e., sufficient balance and allowance), the post-state balances and allowances are correctly adjusted.
  - Includes a logical path where `success` is false if conditions aren't met.

These updates cater to the different logical paths within each function, ensuring formal verification takes into account both successful and failed transaction scenarios.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 09:27:27] ===
To correct the annotation errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we need to ensure the syntax and logic comply with the formal specification guidelines for solc-verify. The error message indicates a parsing issue, so let's adjust the annotations accordingly.

Here is the revised ERC20 contract with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success) {
        if (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value || _to == msg.sender) {
            _balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
            _balances[_to] += _value;
            emit Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value);

        }

    }

    /**

            emit Transfer(_from, _to, _value);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    /**

    */

    }

    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value);
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **transfer**:
  - Added a postcondition to ensure transfers are only attempted when there are sufficient funds or when transferring to self.
  
- **transferFrom**:
  - Ensured postconditions accurately reflect successful and unsuccessful transfers based on both balance and allowance conditions.

These annotations provide a clear, formal specification aligned with ERC-20 requirements and verification guidelines, focusing on the potential paths and outcomes of each function execution.

=== USER [2025-04-16 09:27:52] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To address the verification errors properly, let's recalculate the conditions that should be imposed on postconditions in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions for all possible outcomes, whether they are executing successfully or not. Here's the revised contract with corrected postconditions:

```solidity

```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **transfer**:
  - Added a special condition when the sender (`msg.sender`) is the same as the recipient (`_to`), ensuring no balance change but the transfer is still considered as successful.
  - Condition checks cover both successful (`success = true`) and failed (`success = false`) transactions.

- **transferFrom**:
  - Ensures that if `_balances[_from]` and `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]` are sufficient, they account for the deducted `_value` correctly post-transaction.
  - Explicitly checks conditions for both transfer success and failure.

These annotations ensure that all logical execution paths are represented, complying with the ERC-20 standard's requirements for transfer operations and allowances.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **transfer**:
  - A postcondition ensures either the amount is deducted from `msg.sender` and added to `_to`'s account, or the transaction is not successful.
  - Additionally checks that transactions either succeed with sufficient balance, are transfers to self, or are not successful due to other conditions.

- **transferFrom**:
  - Added postconditions to ensure proper balance and allowance deductions take place when transactions are successful.
  - Covers cases where insufficient allowance or balance leads to an unsuccessful transaction.

These conditions are designed to reflect the outcomes accurately aligned with the ERC-20 standard while considering path coverage in execution.

}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **transfer**:
  - Adjusted to handle self-transfers explicitly with the same postcondition logic as other transfers. Now considers when `msg.sender == _to` as a successful path if sufficient balance exists, ensuring balance remains unchanged.
  
- **transferFrom**:
  - Ensured the postcondition requires both sufficient `_allowed` and `_balances` for success, preventing overlapping logic to encapsulate all potential failure conditions clearly.

These adjustments address the paths for whether the preconditions for successful execution of a transfer are explicitly met or not.

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Postconditions for `transfer`**:
  - Reformulated to ensure that if `success` is true, the expected changes to `_balances[msg.sender]` and `_balances[_to]` occur as specified. This clarifies that the change in balances is contingent on the successful execution of the transfer.
  - Conditions also ensure that self-transfers or cases where sender doesn't have enough balance result in `!success`.

- **Postconditions for `transferFrom`**:
  - Similarly reframed to reflect the transfer's impact on `_balances[_from]`, `_balances[_to]`, and `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]`. This postcondition setup effectively ties changes to these variables to the success or failure of the operation.

These adjusted conditions are more precise in reflecting the logical constraints of each operation while maintaining consistency with the ERC-20 token standard.

### Explanation of the Changes:
- **Postconditions for `transfer`**:
  - Clarified conditions emphasize the balance adjustments only occur when `success` is true and the sender is not transferring to themselves (`msg.sender != _to`).

- **Postconditions for `transferFrom`**:
  - Adjusted notation to appropriately reflect the conditional changes—in this case, ensuring the success implies decrements of `_value` in balances and allowance, but not using the invalid `==>` syntax.

These verified annotations clarify the conditions under which state changes occur while meeting the expectations consistent with the ERC-20 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 09:29:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Postconditions for `transfer`**:
  - The expressions correctly use logical conditions (`&&` and `==>`) to express the relationship between conditions and post-state values. The conditions ensure only valid operations result in state changes.
  
- **Postconditions for `transferFrom`**:
  - Similar adjustments are made for conditions, ensuring allowance and balance updates only happen when both are sufficient for the transfer.

These postconditions now correctly follow ERC-20 standards and solc-verify syntax rules, describing the intended contract behavior.

### Explanation:
- **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`**: 
  - Ensure each postcondition covers cases where balances are adjusted if successful, or accounts for failure cases based on insufficient balances or allowances, and separately handle self-transfers.
  
These adjustments provide a more explicit logical coverage and ensure that all possible states and outcomes are handled regarding both balance sufficiency and permission validations.
