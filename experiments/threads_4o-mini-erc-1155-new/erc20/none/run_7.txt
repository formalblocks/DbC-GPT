    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 09:36:56] ===
To properly annotate an ERC20 smart contract with formal verification conditions, we need to add postcondition annotations for each function. These annotations specify the expected state changes or outputs based on the ERC20 standard. Below is the contract code with the added postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _to) || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice emits Transfer
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_from == _to) || (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice emits Transfer
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value && success || !success
    /// @notice emits Approval
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation
- **View functions** (`totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `allowance`): Their postconditions simply confirm their return values match the expected state variables.
  
- **`transfer` function**: The postcondition checks if the sender's balance decreases and the `_to` address's balance increases by `_value` when the transaction is successful. It also handles self-transfer, where `_to` equals `msg.sender`. The emitted event is specified but not formally expressed in a postcondition annotation.

- **`transferFrom` function**: Similar to `transfer`, but it also considers allowance reduction and incorporates authorization checks. Self-transfer is managed, and the event emission is noted.

- **`approve` function**: The function sets or overwrites the allowance and indicates that an `Approval` event should be emitted, ensuring the mapping matches the expected state after execution.

Each function has its logic and respective postconditions tailored to match the behaviors mandated by the ERC20 standard, ensuring accurate state changes and outcomes.

To appropriately annotate the given ERC20 smart contract with formal verification postconditions using the solc-verify syntax, we need to describe how function calls impact the contract state, considering the ERC20 standard requirements. Here is the annotated contract with proper postconditions that align with these requirements:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Details in Postconditions:
- **`totalSupply` Function**: Confirms that the returned supply matches `_totalSupply`.

- **`transfer` Function**: 
  - `success` condition ensures that if the transfer is successful, it accurately reflects changes in balances.
  - Special handling allows transfer of 0 tokens.
  - `emits Transfer` covers the event emission requirement.

- **`transferFrom` Function**:
  - Considers both `_balances` and `_allowed` to ensure the transfer can proceed.
  - Similar conditions as `transfer`, with additional checks for allowance.
  - Handles cases for 0 token transfers and normal event emissions.

- **`approve` Function**:
  - Ensures the allowance is set correctly and notes the possibility of emitting the `Approval` event.
  - Covers both the landscape of success or failure of operation.

- **`balanceOf` and `allowance` Functions**:
  - Simply ensure that the return values match the corresponding state mappings (`_balances`, `_allowed`).

These annotations are formal and demonstrate adherence to the expected behaviors of ERC20 tokens according to the standard, ensuring consistency and proper state maintenance in every function. Additionally, `Transfer` and `Approval` events are noted for appropriate functions but are not implemented here, as they would generally involve a separate logging mechanism.

To properly add postconditions to an ERC20 smart contract interface using `solc-verify`, we need to ensure that each function's postconditions reflect the correct state transformations or outputs based on the ERC20 specification. Here is your contract with the added postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_value == 0 || (_value <= _balances[msg.sender] && success)) && ((_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || (_to == msg.sender))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_value == 0 || (_value <= _balances[_from] && _value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender] && success)) && ((_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || (_from == _to))
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value && success || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation
- **`totalSupply`**:
  - Guarantee the supply returned is equal to `_totalSupply`.

- **`transfer`**:
  - When the transfer is successful and not a self-transfer, the `msg.sender`'s balance decreases, and the `_to` balance increases by `_value`.
  - Transfer of 0 values is handled as a normal case.
  - Emit conditions are handled but not explicitly specified due to limitations in postcondition syntax; they're implied.

- **`transferFrom`**:
  - When the transfer is successful and not a self-transfer, decreases `_from`'s balance and the allowance and increases `_to` balance by `_value`.
  - Similar handling for 0 value transfers.
  - Ensures `_allowed` map is updated correctly regarding allowances.

- **`approve`**:
  - Verifies that `_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]` is updated to `_value`, reflecting changes in allowances.

- **`balanceOf`** and **`allowance`**:
  - Ensure the returned values match mappings for `_balances` and `_allowed`, respectively.

This annotated contract confirms that each operation results in expected state changes, following the ERC20 token standard, while ensuring accurate formal verification via `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 09:38:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

To address the postcondition errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions of the ERC20 smart contract interface, we can refine the postconditions by ensuring they correctly reflect the requirements and conditions as expressed by the ERC20 standard. We need to review the logic for both self-transfers and failure conditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_to == msg.sender) || (_value == 0 && success) || (_value > 0 && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && success && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || (!success)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_from == _to) || (_value == 0 && success) || (_value > 0 && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) && success && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || (!success)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value && success || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- **`transfer`**:
  - Added condition to handle successful transfers precisely where `_value > 0` and it's less than or equal to the sender’s balance.
  - Special condition for self-transfers where no effective change occurs.
  - Consideration for unsuccessful transfer cases properly handled with the `|| (!success)`.

- **`transferFrom`**:
  - Included success condition with checks ensuring the `_value` is within `_balances[_from]` and the allowance.
  - Managed self-transfer cases and checked for permission via `_allowed`.
  - Consideration for unsuccessful transfer cases properly handled with the `|| (!success)`.

These refined postconditions should align more closely with possible execution paths and ERC20 specifications, ensuring correct verification by the tool. They maintain focus on changes (or no changes, for self-transfers) in balances and allowances precisely to ensure that all logical cases are handled.
