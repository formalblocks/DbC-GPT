=== USER [2025-04-16 09:21:58] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

These annotations represent as precisely as possible the expected behavior of each function according to the ERC20 standard. For modifying functions, the annotations include postconditions about the correctness of balance changes and more. For view functions, the return values are correctly specified as reflecting the relevant state variables.

### Key Adjustments
- **Handled Self-Transfers**: Added conditions that account for when `_from` is equal to `_to` to avoid unnecessary state changes.
- **Allowance Check**: Ensured the allowance update and balance update happens only on successful execution, and ensured changes align with the old state values.

These modifications should help resolve the issue while keeping the annotations aligned with ERC20 specifications.

To address the errors you're encountering with the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, let's update the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the intended behavior and handle all necessary cases correctly, including coverage of both successful and unsuccessful attempts.

Here's the updated contract with annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _value <= _balances[msg.sender] || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition msg.sender == _to || _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _value <= _balances[_from] && _value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender] || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _from == _to || _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) || !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:
- **Condition Correction**: Addresses should include valid checks for `_value` comparisons against `_balances` and `_allowed`.
- **Handling Unsuccessful Cases**: Ensures postconditions address scenarios where conditions for `success` aren't met.
- **Consider All Paths**: For instance, whether `_from` is `_to` and its effects on balances when such transfers occur.

These modifications should better align the postconditions with the intended behavior of the contract functions.

### Key Adjustments:

- **Handling Self-Transfers**: Ensured that the conditions account for the possibility of `_to` being equal to the sender or `_from`.
- **Transfer Success and Failure**: Clarified the handling of balances and allowances to ensure conditions are met both in successful and failure states.
- **Conformance with ERC20 Standard**: Adjusted conditions to reflect critical logical checks about token allowances and balances.
- **Structural Consistency**: Ensured the postconditions are consistently defined relative to corresponding state changes and parameters.

These modifications ensure postconditions reflect the specification's requirements and correct any errors observed in previous contexts.

We can refine the postconditions to more accurately reflect the functionality and ensure that all necessary conditions are considered, especially those pertaining to unsuccessful conditions due to insufficient balance or allowance.

Here is the updated contract with revised postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _value <= _balances[msg.sender] || !success
    /// @notice postcondition msg.sender == _to || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition success == (_value <= _balances[msg.sender] && (_to != msg.sender || _value == 0))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _value <= _balances[_from] && _value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender] || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _from == _to || (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition success == (_value <= _balances[_from] && _value <= _allowed[_from][msg.sender])
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Success Determinants**: Explicitly defined `success` conditions based on accessible balance and allowance.
2. **Unchanged State When Unsuccessful**: Ensured postconditions handle the unchanged state if the transfer is unsuccessful.
3. **Special Handling**: Considered special cases like zero transfers and self-transfers appropriately.
4. **Logical Clarity**: Emphasized logical conditions for when the operation is valid, tying `success` explicitly to these evaluations.

These adjustments should provide more accurate verification conditions that align with the expected behavior as per the ERC20 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Let's refine the postconditions to ensure they properly reflect the logic required for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, considering all paths and edge cases, including the possibility of unsuccessful execution (which should not alter the state).

Here are the updated annotations for the ERC20 contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /// @notice postcondition (_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition success == (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Transfer Logic Validation**: Addressed conditions to check if `_balances[msg.sender]` or `_allowed[_from][msg.sender]` appropriately cover the `_value`.
- **State Changes Only on Success**: Ensured the postconditions reflect no change in balances or allowances if preconditions aren't met.
- **Consistent Success Definition**: For all transfer and allowance usage, tied the `success` variables directly to successful state checks.

These modifications aim to fulfil the ERC20 specification requirements accurately, handling all specified conditions comprehensively.

```

### Key Adjustments:
- **Account for Zero Transfers**: Zero value transfers are treated explicitly as normal and successful, unless they are self-transfers.
- **Postconditions**: They have been updated to cover both the scenario where actions are successful (and state changes occur) and when they fail (without state changes).
- **Balance and Allowance Validations**: Proper checks and balances are implemented to handle both decrease and increase accurately.

These changes should ensure correct handling and annotation of the behaviors needed for proper functioning and validity as per the ERC20 specification.

To address the verification errors you're encountering, let's refine the postconditions so they more accurately represent the intended logic and ensure they hold under all valid scenarios. The key issues seem to relate to ensuring the correct checking of balances and allowing successful transfers, especially for zero values.

Here are the revised annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition success == (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition success == (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments: 
- **Account for Sufficient Balance**: Ensured preconditions correctly determine if the balance or allowance is sufficient for the transaction.
- **Successful State Change**: Updated for successful state changes when transactions succeed, reflecting the change in balances.
- **Zero Transfer Handling**: Treated zero transfers as normal transactions, assured by postconditions tying state updates to transaction success.
- **Consistent Balances and Allowance Validation**: Each function validates both balances and allowances before proceeding, linked to the `success` outcome.

These updates should help address the verification errors by providing clear logical boundaries for when the transfer operations can be considered valid and when they should not affect the state.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;

    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

To address the verification errors, we need to refine the postconditions to adequately reflect the behavior expected of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. Let's make sure to handle successful as well as unsuccessful scenarios correctly. Here's the updated smart contract with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition ((_balances[msg.sender] >= _value) && success && msg.sender != _to) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition ((_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value) && success && _from != _to) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Postcondition Logic**: It's important that each condition for success includes logical checks that ensure sufficient balance and allowance for the transfers.
- **Correct Handling of State Changes**: For both functions, adjustments are made to ensure balances/allowances are correctly updated only when a transaction is deemed successful.
- **Ensure Success**: Clearly define when the operations will succeed, linking back to required conditions like having sufficient balance.

These updated annotations should help resolve the verification errors and ensure each function is properly annotated according to its specifications.
