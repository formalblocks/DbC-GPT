    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

Below is the provided smart contract interface with added formal verification conditions for each function using `solc-verify`:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

Each function now has one or more postconditions capturing the expected effects on state variables based on the behavior defined in the ERC20 standard. The conditions ensure that returned values match state values or that appropriate deductions and credits occur during balance updates. They also enforce success or failure expectations for functions that return a boolean success flag.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 09:48:49] ===
The verification errors you are encountering are related to failing postconditions in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. The issue likely stems from postconditions that are too strict or don't account for all scenarios such as self-transfers and unsuccessful transfers due to insufficient funds or allowance.

Let’s refine the conditions to ensure they capture all scenarios, including the edge cases:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) && success) || !success

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Notes:
- For the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, handling self-transfers (`msg.sender == _to` or `_from == _to`) ensures that the postcondition reflects when no actual balance change occurs but the operation is considered a success.
- The `success` flag is used to branch conditions based on whether the transaction succeeded or failed, covering both potential outcomes.
- The `!success` condition allows postconditions where balances or allowances do not change, preventing errors when the verifier checks these cases.

By refining the postconditions, the verification ensures all edge cases are accounted for, such as transactions involving the same sender and receiver or insufficient funds and allowance scenarios.

Let's address the error messages by refining the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions.

The errors indicate that the postconditions for `_balances[_to]` may not hold, particularly in cases where `success` is false. We need to ensure that postconditions address situations where the operations do not succeed, such as when `_value` is greater than the available balance or allowance.

Here's the refined contract with postconditions to address these scenarios:

```solidity

### Key Changes:

- **Success vs. Non-Success:** The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` now explicitly separate scenarios where the transaction is successful from those where it is not. If the transaction is not successful, the balances remain unchanged from their previous state.
  
- **Self-Transfer:** The condition addresses self-transfer, where the sender and receiver are the same. In such cases, `_balances[_to]` should remain unchanged for the transaction to be considered valid.

These conditions now comprehensively cover both successful and unsuccessful transaction scenarios, ensuring the balances are correctly adjusted only when the transfers are valid.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

The mistakes in the annotations appear to be related to formatting issues within the postcondition expressions and the use of logical structures. Let's fix these issues and ensure the annotations are correctly formatted.

Here is the contract with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

     * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

     */

    /// @notice postcondition success ==>

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

     */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

     */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments

1. **Consistency**: Ensure that logical operators (`||`, `&&`) are placed correctly between conditions. Use `==>` to denote that if the left condition is true, then the right condition must also be true.

2. **Guarantees**: Ensure `success` is only guaranteed if the conditions for a valid transfer are met, else `!success`.

3. **Self-Transfers**: The previous balance of sender (`msg.sender`) should not change if it is the same as `_to`.

By providing clear logical flows and avoiding unnecessary complexity, these annotations should now compile and verify correctly. Adjust as needed if any specific edge cases arise during verification.

### Key Considerations

- **Success Condition**: Ensure the success postcondition aligns with whether the function is expected to succeed based on the inputs and state.

- **Self-transfer Handling**: Explicitly handle the case where `_from` is equal to `_to` or `msg.sender` is equal to `_to`, ensuring no change in balance in such scenarios.

- **Verification Syntax**: The logical operators and variable references must align with standard syntax and verification guidelines, using state variables directly and referencing old values using `__verifier_old_uint`.

The above conditions reflect transactions' validity, balance consistency, and allowance correctness per the ERC20 standard behavior. Adjust the conditions as needed based on implementation details or additional constraints in your smart contract.

To resolve the verification errors for `transfer` and `transferFrom`, we need to ensure that the postconditions comprehensively check all scenarios, especially those where the balance of `_to` might not increase due to an unsuccessful transfer or a zero-value transfer. Zero-value transfers should still be recognized as valid operations without changing the balance. 

Let's correct and ensure all conditions match the ERC20 standard and include states for both success and failure outcomes:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Success vs. Failure**: Both transfer functions now properly address situations where balances are not changed due to an unsuccessful transfer or because the operation was effectively a self-transfer (`msg.sender == _to` or `_from == _to`).

2. **Zero-Value Transactions**: Both `transfer` and `transferFrom` allow zero-value transactions to execute without altering balances, in accordance with ERC20 standards.

This should help clarify all conditions surrounding both successful and unsuccessful transfer attempts, aligning closely with the ERC20 standard requirements. Make sure to adjust according to any implementation specifics not covered here.

We need to refine the postcondition so that it correctly reflects these possible cases while staying consistent with the ERC20 specification.

}
```

### Adjustments Made:

1. **Zero-Value Transfers**: Annotations now explicitly check for `_value > 0` when updating the `_balances[_to]`. This is because a zero-value transfer doesn't change the balances.

2. **Self-Transfer Handling**: The condition `(msg.sender == _to)` allows for the scenario where the tokens are transferred back to the sender, which should not reduce their balance.

3. **Successful vs Unsuccessful Transfers**: We've separated logic clearly for successful and unsuccessful executions using the `success` flag and the comparison of _value against the sender's balance.

These changes should ensure the correct handling of all specified scenarios as per the ERC20 standard.

The errors you're encountering with the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions are related to the logic of the postconditions. The transfer logic needs to ensure that zero-value transfers are valid but do not alter the balance if unsuccessful, consistent with the ERC20 standard's requirements to allow zero-value transfers as regular operations.

Let's refine the postconditions to accurately reflect the behavior as specified by the ERC20 standard:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

```

### Explanation:

1. **Condition Adjustment for Success and Balance**: The annotation now checks if `success` implies both sender and receiver's balances will reflect the transaction if conditions are met (balance sufficient and not self-transfer).

2. **Correct Handling of self-transfers**: It handles cases where `_from == _to` and `msg.sender == _to`, ensuring no actual balance reduction when transferring to oneself.

3. **Non-Successful Execution**: For both `transfer` and `transferFrom`, `success` must imply the conditions necessary for the transfer to succeed. If these conditions aren't met (e.g., insufficient balance), the postconditions fallback to ensure `!success` is maintained without state change.

These adjustments ensure the postconditions reflect both successful and unsuccessful cases while adhering to the zero-value transfer requirements of ERC20.

        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the verification errors, the logic for `success` must be correctly expressed in the postconditions. The condition should encapsulate when the transaction is valid, considering the balance and allowance. Let's refine the postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    */

    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender])) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) || _from == _to || !success

    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender])) || !success

    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /** 
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`. 
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /** 
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`. 
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments:

- **Self-transfers**: Conditions now include situations where `msg.sender == _to` or `_from == _to`, ensuring no balance change when transferring to oneself.
- **Successful Execution**: The `success` flag is conditioned both by the sufficiency of balance/allowance and by ensuring that balances reflect the expected changes only when the transaction is valid.
  
### Explanation:

- The postconditions ensure that for both `transfer` and `transferFrom`, the balances and allowances only change in accordance to the conditions of valid transfers. If these conditions are not satisfied, the postconditions default to reflecting no change and `!success`.

This setup provides a robust foundation for the expected behavior of ERC20 token operations.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 09:52:27] ===
The errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions indicate that the postconditions regarding balance updates may not always be held. This is likely because we need to handle zero-value transfers and ensure the recipient's balance is updated only when the transfer is valid.

Let's refine the postconditions to correctly cover these scenarios:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && msg.sender != _to && success) || msg.sender == _to
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && success) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _from != _to && success) || _from == _to

    /// @notice postcondition (_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value && success) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition (_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _value <= __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) && success) || !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Considerations:

1. **Success Check**: Ensure the transfer only updates balances if it is successful and that zero-value transfers are correctly handled.
   
2. **Self-transfer Handling**: Ensure that when `msg.sender == _to` or `_from == _to`, the balance remains unchanged.

These refined postconditions should address verification errors through appropriate handling of self-transfers and zero-value edge cases. They ensure the logical correctness of state changes according to the ERC20 standard.
