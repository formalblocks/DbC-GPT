    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

These postconditions aim to accurately reflect the expected behavior as described in the ERC20 standard. They ensure the proper update of balances and allowances, and the conditions for successful and unsuccessful transfers, as well as handle the special case of self-transfers.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-16 09:39:20] ===
To resolve the verification errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we need to adjust the postconditions to correctly represent possible state transitions and conditions. Specifically, we should ensure conditions handle cases such as insufficient balances or allowances correctly and handle zero-value transfers. Let's review the postconditions and update them accordingly:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender != _to) ==> (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)

    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value && _value == 0) || (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value && success) || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to) ==> (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)
    /// @notice postcondition _from == _to || (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value)
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && _value == 0) || (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value && success) || !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

- For `transfer`, the postconditions now correctly handle the possibility of a zero transfer and use the implication operator to separate cases where `msg.sender` equals `_to` and when it doesn't.

- For `transferFrom`, the corrected postconditions now use the implication operator and ensure both balance and allowance are considered, including when `_value` is zero.

This should resolve potential errors identified by the verifier while ensuring the contract behaves according to the ERC20 standard.

The error messages indicate issues with the logical syntax used in the annotations, specifically the implication operator `==>` which is not supported in solc-verify annotations. Let's correct this by using appropriate logical operations without using unsupported operators. Logical expressions such as implications can be expressed using basic logical operations like conjunctions (`&&`), disjunctions (`||`), and conditionals.

Here is the corrected version of the postconditions for each function:

    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

- For `transfer`, the conditions ensure that the sender has a sufficient balance and that the balances are updated correctly after a successful transfer, with handling for zero-value transfers as normal operations.
  
- For `transferFrom`, the postconditions assert that both the balance and allowance constraints are respected for a successful transfer, checking both pre- and post-operation states, including handling when no changes occur if the operation is unsuccessful.

These changes should correct the errors encountered during verification.

To resolve the verification errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we need to refine the logical conditions to align correctly with the intent of the ERC20 standard. We need to ensure that the conditions express the possible scenarios accurately, covering success and failure paths distinctly without using unsupported constructs. Here's the refined approach:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transfer:**
   - The first postcondition specifies that if the `transfer` was successful, the caller must have had enough balance to transfer the `_value`. If unsuccessful, it indicates not enough balance or some other failure condition.
   - The second postcondition ensures that, after a successful transfer, the sender's balance is reduced by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by `_value`.

2. **TransferFrom:**
   - The first postcondition checks that both the balance of `_from` and the allowance from `_from` for the caller are sufficient if the transfer is successful. If not successful, the result might indicate insufficient balance or allowance.
   - The second postcondition ensures that after a successful `transferFrom`, balances and allowances are appropriately updated.

These conditions should provide clearer verification paths and help confirm that the functions adhere to the contract's stated rules and behaviors.

The issue with the previous annotations is that the `implies` keyword is not recognized by the solc-verify tool, as it doesn't support complex logical implications directly. We need to use conjunctions and ensure conditions are written in a supported format. Let's correct the annotations by using logical `&&` for conjunctions and directly stating conditions:

```solidity

```

### Explanation:

1. **Transfer:**
   - The first postcondition checks if the transfer succeeds, ensures sufficient balance exists, and handles the special case where `_value` is 0.
   - The second postcondition updates the balances conditionally if the transfer is successful and checks within the implication that `msg.sender` is not transferring to themselves.

2. **TransferFrom:**
   - It checks that both the balance and allowance are sufficient if the transfer is successful and `_value` is nonzero.
   - It ensures account balances and allowances are updated correctly when the transfer succeeds, using conditional handling for self-transfer and zero-value transfers.

These revisions clarify logic for each postcondition and avoid using unsupported syntax.

The errors indicate the use of the `==>` operator, which is not supported by solc-verify. Let's adjust the postconditions to use direct logical conjunctions (`&&`) and disjunctions (`||`) instead of implications. Here's the revised version:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    */

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transfer:**
   - The first postcondition ensures a successful transfer only if the sender's balance is sufficient.
   - The second postcondition uses a ternary-like comprehension to ensure that if the transfer is successful and not a self-transfer (`msg.sender != _to`), then the state variables `_balances` should reflect the transfer; otherwise, no state change occurs.

2. **TransferFrom:**
   - The first postcondition checks for sufficient balance and allowance for success.
   - The second postcondition ensures that if the transfer is successful and `_from != _to`, balances and allowances reflect the transfer.

This approach sticks to conjunctions and conditional updates to accurately capture the contract's logic, without relying on unsupported syntax.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Here are improved postconditions:

```solidity

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:
- For `transfer`:
  - The postconditions account for both cases where the sender and recipient are the same (`msg.sender == _to`) and when they are different.
  - We ensure that the postcondition reflects the balance change only when the transfer is successful.
  - It covers the success condition by checking if the sender's balance is enough and the value is correctly deducted.
  
- For `transferFrom`:
  - Similar logic is applied as with `transfer`, handling the self-transfer situation (`_from == _to`) separately.
  - It covers successful transfers by ensuring both balance and allowance are sufficient and properly updated.

These annotations account for both successful and failed transactions while preserving contract invariants. They should help guide the verifier effectively by outlining the expected contract behaviors per function.

To resolve the issues with verification errors for `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, we can refine the postconditions to accurately reflect the expected behavior of these functions per the ERC20 standard. The critical aspect is ensuring that conditions specify the required pre-conditions for success and account for both scenarios when the function succeeds or fails. Here's the corrected proposal:

```solidity

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transfer:**
   - **First Postcondition:** Ensures that for success, the sender's balance must be reduced by `_value`, and this only happens if the balance was sufficient.
   - **Second Postcondition:** Captures scenarios where the transaction fails, ensuring no change to the state.
   - **Third Postcondition:** Handles the change for successful transactions and differentiates self-transfer (no effective change) from normal transfer.

2. **TransferFrom:**
   - **First Postcondition:** Stipulates that for a successful transfer, both the balance and allowance must be sufficient.
   - **Second Postcondition:** Similarly, ensures no change for unsuccessful transactions.
   - **Third Postcondition:** Reflects allowance and balance deductions for successful transfers, capturing both normal and self-transfer scenarios.

This approach more precisely describes all logical outcomes for function execution, addressing potential verifications errors by thoroughly handling both successful and unsuccessful branches in a way that is verifiable by solc-verify.

To resolve the verification errors, we should carefully revise the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions by ensuring all paths are appropriately covered. The goal is to develop postconditions that express logic reflecting the function's requirement to succeed only if certain conditions about balances and allowances hold true.

Here's how we can improve them:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping(address => uint) _balances;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _balances[msg.sender] >= _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) || (msg.sender == _to && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]))
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || msg.sender == _to
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value) || !success

    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || _from == _to
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || !success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transfer:**
   - The first postcondition checks if the transfer can succeed based on the balance being sufficient.
   - The second postcondition calculates the new balance of the sender after a successful transfer, and accounts for the case of self-transfer (`msg.sender == _to`).
   - The third postcondition updates the recipient's balance only in non-self transfers.

2. **TransferFrom:**
   - The first postcondition checks both the balance and allowance for the transfer's success.
   - The second and third postconditions handle balance updates similarly, especially in the case of self-transfer (`_from == _to`).
   - The final postcondition ensures that the allowance is correctly reduced only if the transfer is truly successful.

These conditions aim to provide a clear logic path that should address the verifier's concerns, balancing both intended behaviors and correctness verification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 09:42:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To address the verification errors in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions of the ERC20 contract, we will improve the postconditions to ensure they correctly reflect the required logical checks for the operations. We need to ensure that success conditions cover the necessary balance and allowance checks appropriately. Let's revise the postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[msg.sender] >= _value || msg.sender == _to) && success || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value) || msg.sender == _to
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || msg.sender == _to
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_from] >= _value && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value || _from == _to) && success || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value) || _from == _to
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) || _from == _to
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == (__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value) || _from == _to
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Transfer:**
   - **First Postcondition:** Handles the requirement that for transfer to succeed, the sender must have enough tokens or be transferring to themselves, which doesn't change the balance.
   - **Second and Third Postconditions:** Ensure correct token deductions and additions, and account for potential self-transfer scenarios where balances remain unchanged.

2. **TransferFrom:**
   - **First Postcondition:** Checks both the balance and allowance conditions for success, with the added condition for self-transfer, which simplifies the logic.
   - **Remaining Postconditions:** Adjust balances and allowances correctly for successful transfers, with a special case for self-transfer ensuring no change.

These changes ensure the conditions are aligned with the ERC20 standard logic and provide accurate verification paths for both success and failure outcomes.
