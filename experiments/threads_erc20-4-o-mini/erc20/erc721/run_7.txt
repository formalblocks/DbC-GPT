    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition states that the returned supply must equal the total supply stored in the contract.

2. **transfer**: 
   - The first postcondition checks if the sender is transferring to themselves, in which case their balance remains unchanged.
   - The second postcondition checks if the sender is transferring to a different address, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Similar to `transfer`, the first postcondition checks if the sender is the same as the `_from` address, ensuring their balance remains unchanged if they are transferring to themselves.
   - The second postcondition ensures that if the sender is not the `_from` address, the `_from` address's balance decreases and the `_to` address's balance increases.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for the spender is set to the specified value.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in the contract for the specified owner.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition ensures that the returned allowance matches the allowance stored in the contract for the specified owner and spender.

This structure should resolve the verification error you encountered, particularly for the `transferFrom` function.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition ensures that the returned supply matches the total supply stored in the contract.

2. **transfer**: 
   - The first postcondition checks if the sender is transferring to themselves, in which case their balance remains unchanged.
   - The second postcondition checks if the sender is transferring to a different address, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - The first postcondition checks if the sender is the same as the `_from` address, ensuring their balance remains unchanged if they are transferring to themselves.
   - The second postcondition ensures that if the sender is not the `_from` address, the `_from` address's balance decreases and the `_to` address's balance increases.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for the spender is set to the specified value.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in the contract for the specified owner.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition ensures that the returned allowance matches the allowance stored in the contract for the specified owner and spender.

### Addressing the Verification Error:
The verification error for the `transferFrom` function indicates that the postcondition regarding the `_from` address's balance might not hold. The provided postconditions ensure that the balance checks are correctly handled for both the sender and the recipient, which should resolve the verification issue.

=== USER [2025-04-25 16:23:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition ensures that the returned supply matches the total supply stored in the contract.

2. **transfer**: 
   - The first postcondition checks if the sender is transferring to themselves, in which case their balance remains unchanged.
   - The second postcondition checks if the sender is transferring to a different address, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - The first postcondition checks if the sender is the same as the `_from` address, ensuring their balance remains unchanged if they are transferring to themselves.
   - The second postcondition ensures that if the sender is not the `_from` address, the `_from` address's balance decreases and the `_to` address's balance increases.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for the spender is set to the specified value.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in the contract for the specified owner.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition ensures that the returned allowance matches the allowance stored in the contract for the specified owner and spender.

### Addressing the Verification Error:
The verification error for the `transferFrom` function indicates that the postcondition regarding the `_from` address's balance might not hold. The provided postconditions ensure that the balance checks are correctly handled for both the sender and the recipient, which should resolve the verification issue. 

If the error persists, consider adding additional checks or clarifications in the postconditions to ensure that all edge cases are covered, particularly around the conditions of the sender and recipient being the same or different.

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition ensures that the returned supply matches the total supply stored in the contract.

2. **transfer**: 
   - The first postcondition checks if the sender is transferring to themselves, in which case their balance remains unchanged.
   - The second postcondition checks if the sender is transferring to a different address, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - The first postcondition checks if the sender is the same as the `_from` address, ensuring their balance remains unchanged if they are transferring to themselves.
   - The second postcondition ensures that if the sender is not the `_from` address, the `_from` address's balance decreases and the `_to` address's balance increases.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for the spender is set to the specified value.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in the contract for the specified owner.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition ensures that the returned allowance matches the allowance stored in the contract for the specified owner and spender.

### Addressing the Verification Error:
The verification error for the `transferFrom` function indicates that the postcondition regarding the `_from` address's balance might not hold. The provided postconditions ensure that the balance checks are correctly handled for both the sender and the recipient, which should resolve the verification issue. 

If the error persists, consider adding additional checks or clarifications in the postconditions to ensure that all edge cases are covered, particularly around the conditions of the sender and recipient being the same or different.
