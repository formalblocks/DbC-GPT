=== USER [2025-03-31 22:17:42] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

The postconditions for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function ensure that for each token ID in the `_ids` array, the balance in the `_to` address is correctly updated to reflect the transferred amounts, and the balance in the `_from` address is decremented accordingly. This maintains the integrity of the token balances across multiple transfers in a single batch operation.

The postconditions for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function ensure that for each token ID in the `_ids` array, the balance in the `_to` address is correctly updated to reflect the transferred amounts, and the balance in the `_from` address is decremented accordingly. This maintains the integrity of the token balances across multiple transfers in a single batch operation.

=== USER [2025-03-31 22:19:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

In this code, I have added postconditions for each function in the ERC1155 contract interface. The postconditions ensure that the contract's state is consistent with the expected behavior defined in the ERC1155 standard. Specifically, for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, the postconditions verify that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer operation.

### Postconditions Explained:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the balance returned is equal to the stored balance for that token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` Function**:
   - The postcondition states that the length of the batchBalances array must match the lengths of both the _owners and _ids arrays. Additionally, it verifies that for each index, the balance corresponds to the correct mapping of token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the operator's approval status for the owner is updated to the new value.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - The postcondition verifies that the function returns the correct approval status based on the current mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postcondition confirms that the balance of the token at the destination address has increased by the transferred value, and the balance at the source address has decreased by the same amount, provided the from and to addresses are different.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postconditions ensure that for each token ID being transferred, the balance at the destination address is updated correctly and the balance at the source address is decremented accordingly, maintaining the integrity of the batch transfer operation.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Postconditions Explained:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the `_balances` mapping correctly reflects the current balance of the token specified by `_id` for the owner `_owner`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` Function**:
   - The postcondition checks that the length of the `batchBalances` array matches the lengths of both the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays. It also ensures that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct mapping of token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - The postcondition verifies that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping is updated correctly, indicating whether the operator is approved by the owner.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the function returns the correct approval status based on the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postcondition confirms that after the transfer, the balance of the token at the `_to` address has increased by `_value`, and the balance at the `_from` address has decreased by the same amount, provided that the two addresses are different.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postconditions guarantee that for each token ID in the `_ids` array, the balance at the `_to` address is updated correctly (increased) and the balance at the `_from` address is decremented accordingly, ensuring the integrity of the batch transfer operation.

### Postcondition Descriptions:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the balance returned for a specific token ID and owner address matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` Function**:
   - The postcondition verifies that the `batchBalances` array has the same length as both `_owners` and `_ids`. It also checks that each entry in `batchBalances` correctly reflects the balance for the corresponding token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - The postcondition confirms that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping is updated to reflect the new approval status for the specified operator by the owner.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the function returns the correct approval status from the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the given owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postcondition guarantees that after a successful transfer, the balance of the token at the `_to` address has increased by `_value`, while the balance at the `_from` address has decreased by the same amount, assuming the two addresses are not the same.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postconditions ensure that for each token ID in the `_ids` array, the balance at the `_to` address is incremented by the corresponding value from `_values`, and the balance at the `_from` address is decremented, maintaining the integrity of the batch transfer operation.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Postcondition Explanations:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the `_balances` mapping correctly reflects the current balance of the specified token ID for the given owner address.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` Function**:
   - This postcondition confirms that the `batchBalances` array has the same length as both the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays. It also verifies that each entry in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct mapping of token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping is updated to reflect the new approval status for the specified operator by the owner.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - This postcondition verifies that the function returns the correct approval status based on the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the given owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postcondition guarantees that after the transfer, the balance of the token at the `_to` address has increased by `_value`, while the balance at the `_from` address has decreased by the same amount, assuming the two addresses are different.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postconditions ensure that for each token ID in the `_ids` array, the balance at the `_to` address is incremented by the corresponding value from `_values`, and the balance at the `_from` address is decremented, maintaining the integrity of the batch transfer operation.

### Postcondition Explanations:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the balance returned for the specified token ID and owner matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` Function**:
   - This postcondition verifies that the `batchBalances` array has the same length as the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays. It also checks that each entry in `batchBalances` reflects the correct balance for the corresponding token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping is updated to reflect the new approval status for the specified operator by the owner.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - This postcondition verifies that the function returns the correct approval status from the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the given owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postcondition guarantees that after the transfer, the balance of the token at the `_to` address has increased by `_value`, while the balance at the `_from` address has decreased by the same amount, assuming the two addresses are different.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postconditions ensure that for each token ID in the `_ids` array, the balance at the `_to` address is incremented by the corresponding value from `_values`, and the balance at the `_from` address is decremented, maintaining the integrity of the batch transfer operation.
