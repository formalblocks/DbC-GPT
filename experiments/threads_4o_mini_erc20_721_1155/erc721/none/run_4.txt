=== USER [2025-03-15 16:37:48] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;

``` 

### Explanation:
The postcondition for the `transferFrom` function has been specified to ensure that after the transfer, the token's ownership is correctly updated. The condition checks that the `_tokenOwner` mapping reflects the new owner and that the transfer is between two different addresses. 

This ensures that the function behaves as expected according to the ERC721 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation:
The postcondition for the `transferFrom` function should ensure that the token's ownership is correctly updated after the transfer. Specifically, it should check that the `_tokenOwner` mapping reflects the new owner and that the transfer is between two different addresses.

The condition `( _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to ) && ( _from != _to )` ensures that the token ID is now owned by `_to` and that the owner has changed from `_from` to `_to`.

If the condition is not met, it indicates that the function did not execute correctly, which is why the verifier raised an error.

### Explanation:
The postcondition for the `transferFrom` function must ensure that the token's ownership is correctly updated after the transfer. The condition `( _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to ) && ( _from != _to )` confirms that the `_tokenId` is now owned by `_to` and that the ownership has changed from `_from` to `_to`.

The error message indicates that this postcondition might not hold, which suggests that there is a potential issue in how the function is implemented. It's important to ensure that the function checks that the caller is indeed the current owner, an authorized operator, or the approved address for the token before proceeding with the transfer. If these conditions are not met, the function should revert, preventing any unintended changes to the token's ownership.

### Explanation:
The postcondition for the `transferFrom` function is crucial to ensure that the token's ownership is accurately updated. The condition `( _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to ) && ( _from != _to )` guarantees that the token identified by `_tokenId` is now owned by the address `_to` and that the ownership has changed from `_from` to `_to`.

This postcondition should hold true after the `transferFrom` function is executed. If it does not hold, it indicates that the function did not execute as intended, which could lead to inconsistencies in the token ownership records.

To avoid this issue, the implementation of `transferFrom` must validate that the caller is either the current owner of the token, an approved operator, or the approved address for that token before performing the transfer. If these conditions are not met, the function should revert, preventing any unintended changes to the token's state.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the number of tokens owned by `_owner` matches the balance returned by the function.
2. **ownerOf**: The postcondition confirms that the `_tokenOwner` mapping correctly reflects the current owner of the token with ID `_tokenId`.
3. **approve**: The postcondition states that the `_tokenApprovals` mapping should point to the approved address for the specified token ID.
4. **getApproved**: The postcondition ensures that the returned approved address is the one set by the `approve` function for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The postcondition states that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping should reflect the approval status set by the caller for the specified operator.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The postcondition checks that the approval status for the specified operator on the specified owner's tokens is correctly reflected.
7. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that the token's ownership is transferred correctly, meaning the new owner is `_to` and the old owner was `_from`.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also ensures that if `_to` is a contract, it can handle the token appropriately.
9. **safeTransferFrom with Data**: This function has the same postcondition as `safeTransferFrom`, but allows for additional data to be passed along with the transfer.

It's essential that each of these postconditions accurately reflects the state of the contract after the function executes, ensuring that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: This postcondition ensures that the number of tokens owned by `_owner` is equal to the `balance` returned by the function.
2. **ownerOf**: This postcondition confirms that the `_tokenOwner` mapping correctly reflects the current owner of the token identified by `_tokenId`.
3. **approve**: The postcondition states that the `_tokenApprovals` mapping should point to the approved address for the specified `_tokenId`.
4. **getApproved**: This postcondition ensures that the returned approved address matches the one set by the `approve` function for the specified `_tokenId`.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: This postcondition states that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping should reflect the approval status set by the caller for the specified `_operator`.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: This postcondition checks that the approval status for the specified `_operator` on the specified `_owner`'s tokens is correctly reflected.
7. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that the token's ownership is transferred correctly from `_from` to `_to`, meaning `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` is now `_to` and `_from` is no longer the owner.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also ensures that if `_to` is a contract, it can handle the token appropriately.
9. **safeTransferFrom with Data**: This function has the same postcondition as `safeTransferFrom`, but allows for additional data to be passed along with the transfer.

These postconditions must hold true after the function executes, ensuring that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-15 16:41:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the number of tokens owned by `_owner` is equal to the `balance` returned by the function.
2. **ownerOf**: The postcondition confirms that the `_tokenOwner` mapping correctly reflects the current owner of the token identified by `_tokenId`.
3. **approve**: The postcondition states that the `_tokenApprovals` mapping should point to the approved address for the specified `_tokenId`.
4. **getApproved**: This postcondition ensures that the returned approved address matches the one set by the `approve` function for the specified `_tokenId`.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: This postcondition states that the `_operatorApprovals` mapping should reflect the approval status set by the caller for the specified `_operator`.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: This postcondition checks that the approval status for the specified `_operator` on the specified `_owner`'s tokens is correctly reflected.
7. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that the token's ownership is transferred correctly from `_from` to `_to`, meaning `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` is now `_to` and `_from` is no longer the owner.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also ensures that if `_to` is a contract, it can handle the token appropriately.
9. **safeTransferFrom with Data**: This function has the same postcondition as `safeTransferFrom`, but allows for additional data to be passed along with the transfer.

These postconditions must hold true after the function executes, ensuring that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-15 16:42:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:
