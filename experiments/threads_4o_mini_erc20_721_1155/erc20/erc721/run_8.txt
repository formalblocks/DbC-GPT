=== USER [2025-03-15 15:06:44] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition ensures that the total supply of tokens is equal to the value returned by the `supply` parameter.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition checks that the sender's balance is decreased by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition checks that the sender's balance is decreased by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same. It also ensures that the allowance for the sender is decreased by `_value`.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for the `_spender` is set to `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition checks that the balance of the `_owner` is equal to the value returned by the `balance` parameter.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition checks that the remaining allowance for the `_spender` on the `_owner` account is equal to the value returned by the `remaining` parameter.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition verifies that the sender's balance is decreased by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same address.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that the sender's balance is decreased by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same address. It also checks that the allowance for the sender is decreased by `_value`.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for the `_spender` is set to `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition checks that the balance of the `_owner` matches the `balance` parameter.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition verifies that the amount left that the `_spender` can withdraw from the `_owner` is equal to the `remaining` parameter.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition ensures that the total supply of tokens is equal to the value returned by the `supply` parameter.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition checks that the sender's balance is decreased by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that the sender's balance is decreased by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same. It also checks that the allowance for the sender is decreased by `_value`.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for the `_spender` is set to `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition checks that the balance of the `_owner` is equal to the value returned by the `balance` parameter.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition checks that the amount left that the `_spender` can withdraw from the `_owner` is equal to the value returned by the `remaining` parameter.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **totalSupply**: The total supply of tokens in circulation should equal the value returned by the `supply` parameter.

2. **transfer**: After the transfer, the sender's balance should decrease by `_value`, and the recipient's balance should increase by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same address.

3. **transferFrom**: After the transfer, the sender's balance should decrease by `_value`, and the recipient's balance should increase by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same address. Additionally, the allowance for the sender should decrease by `_value`.

4. **approve**: The allowance for the `_spender` should be set to `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The balance of the `_owner` should equal the value returned by the `balance` parameter.

6. **allowance**: The remaining amount that the `_spender` is allowed to withdraw from the `_owner` should equal the value returned by the `remaining` parameter.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition ensures that the total supply of tokens matches the `supply` parameter.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition checks that the sender's balance is decreased by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same address.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that the sender's balance is decreased by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same address. It also checks that the allowance for the sender is decreased by `_value`.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for the `_spender` is set to `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition checks that the balance of the `_owner` is equal to the `balance` parameter.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition verifies that the amount left that the `_spender` can withdraw from the `_owner` is equal to the `remaining` parameter.

### Additional Notes
The errors you encountered in the verification process suggest that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions might not hold due to potential issues in the implementation of these functions. Make sure that the logic in these functions accurately reflects the intent of the postconditions, especially in handling cases where the sender and recipient are the same address.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **totalSupply**: This postcondition ensures that the total supply of the tokens in circulation matches the `supply` parameter returned by the function.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition checks that the sender's balance decreases by `_value` and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`, unless the sender and recipient are the same.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that the `_from` account's balance decreases by `_value` and the `_to` account's balance increases by `_value`, unless `_from` and `_to` are the same. Additionally, it checks that the allowance for the sender is decreased by `_value`.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition checks that the balance of `_owner` matches the `balance` parameter returned by the function.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition checks that the amount left that `_spender` can withdraw from `_owner` matches the `remaining` parameter returned by the function.

### Additional Notes
The errors you encountered in the verification process suggest issues in the implementation of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. Ensure that these functions are correctly implemented to uphold the specified postconditions, particularly for cases involving self-transfers and the management of balances and allowances.

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}

        ```

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition ensures that the total supply of tokens matches the `supply` parameter returned by the function.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition checks that the sender's balance is decreased by `_value` and the recipient's balance is increased by the same amount, unless the sender and recipient are the same address.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that the `_from` account's balance is decreased by `_value` and the `_to` account's balance is increased by the same amount, unless `_from` and `_to` are the same address. It also checks that the allowance for the sender is decreased by `_value`.

4. **approve**: The postcondition ensures that the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition checks that the balance of `_owner` is equal to the `balance` parameter returned by the function.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition checks that the amount left that `_spender` can withdraw from `_owner` matches the `remaining` parameter returned by the function.

### Additional Notes
The errors you encountered in the verification process suggest that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions might not hold due to potential issues in the implementation of these functions. Make sure that the logic in these functions accurately reflects the intent of the postconditions, especially in handling cases where the sender and recipient are the same address.
