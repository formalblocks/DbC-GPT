Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
/**
    @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
    @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
    @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
    @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
*/

$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);
}
```

EIP markdown below:
<eip>
/**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
</eip>

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?

To address the verification issue, we need to ensure that the postcondition accurately reflects the state of the `_operatorApprovals` mapping without directly referencing the return variable `approved`. Instead, we can reference the mapping directly to express the relationship between the input parameters and the expected return value.

Hereâ€™s the corrected postcondition:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
/**
    @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
    @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
    @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
    @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
*/

/// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
/// @notice postcondition forall (address operator) _operatorApprovals[_owner][operator] == __verifier_old_bool(_operatorApprovals[_owner][operator])
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);
}
```

In this updated version, the first postcondition remains the same, ensuring that the return value `approved` corresponds to the mapping value for the given `_owner` and `_operator`. The second postcondition ensures that the approval status for all operators remains unchanged before and after the function call, which is appropriate for a view function. 

This should resolve the verification issue.
