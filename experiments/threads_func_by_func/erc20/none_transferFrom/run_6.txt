=== USER [2025-05-22 06:36:02] ===
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {
mapping (address => uint256) private _balances;

mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) private _allowed;

uint256 private _totalSupply;

#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

}
```

In this updated specification, I have modified the quantified postconditions to allow for the possibility that the allowances for other addresses remain unchanged or are reset to zero, which should satisfy the verifier's requirements.

In this revision, I have removed the conditions that allowed the allowances to be reset to zero. Instead, I ensure that the allowances for other addresses remain unchanged unless they are directly involved in the transfer. This should satisfy the verifier's requirements.

In this revision, I have adjusted the postconditions to ensure that the allowances for the `_from` address and other addresses are preserved unless they are directly involved in the transfer. This should satisfy the verifier's requirements while maintaining the integrity of the allowances.

In this revision, I have added a condition to ensure that the allowance for the `_from` address remains unchanged if it is not directly involved in the transfer. This should address the verifier's concerns while maintaining the integrity of the allowances and balances.

In this revision, I have simplified the postconditions related to allowances.

This should satisfy the verifier's requirements.

In this revision, I have made adjustments to the postconditions to ensure they are valid and should satisfy the verifier's requirements. The conditions now ensure that allowances for addresses other than `_from` remain unchanged, while also explicitly stating that the allowance for `_from` is preserved unless it is directly involved in the transfer. This should address the verifier's concerns effectively.
