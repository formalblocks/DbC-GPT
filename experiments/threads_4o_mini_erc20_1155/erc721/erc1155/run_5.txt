    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner. If the sender is the same as the recipient, there should be no change.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner. The previous owner should be verified.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:43:57] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should match the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner. The previous owner should be verified.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:44:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner, and the previous owner should be verified. The count of tokens owned by both the previous and new owners should be updated accordingly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply, with updates to the token counts.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:45:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner. The previous owner should be verified. The counts of tokens owned by both the previous and new owners should be updated accordingly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply, with updates to the token counts.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic. 

### Note:
The postconditions for the transfer functions include conditions for both the old and new token counts to maintain consistency. The use of `__verifier_old_uint` is appropriate for referring to the previous state of the token count before the transfer. Adjustments should be made to ensure that the variables `_oldCountFrom` represent the previous count of tokens owned by the sender before the transfer.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:46:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner, and the previous owner should be verified. The counts of tokens owned by both the previous and new owners should be updated accordingly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply, with updates to the token counts.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic. The use of `__verifier_old_uint` allows referencing the previous state of the token counts before any changes are applied.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:47:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner, and the previous owner should be verified. The counts of tokens owned by both the previous and new owners should be updated accordingly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply, with updates to the token counts.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic. 

### Note:
Make sure to replace any placeholder variables (like `_oldCountFrom`) with actual logic or state references that you maintain in your implementation, as they are not explicitly defined in the provided interface.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:48:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner. The previous owner should be verified. The counts of tokens owned by both the previous and new owners should be updated accordingly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply, with updates to the token counts.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic. 

### Important Note:
Make sure to replace any placeholder variables (like `_oldCountFrom`) with actual logic or state references that you maintain in your implementation, as they are not explicitly defined in the provided interface.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:49:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner. The previous owner should be verified. The counts of tokens owned by both the previous and new owners should be updated accordingly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply, with updates to the token counts.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic. 

### Important Note:
Make sure to replace any placeholder variables or expressions (like `_oldCountFrom`) with actual logic or state references that you maintain in your implementation, as they are not explicitly defined in the provided interface.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:50:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The address returned should be the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the token ID should match the new approved address after the call.
4. **getApproved**: The address returned should be the currently approved address for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator should be updated to match the provided value.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value should indicate whether the operator is approved for managing the owner's tokens.
7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the token should be transferred to the new owner. The previous owner should be verified. The counts of tokens owned by both the previous and new owners should be updated accordingly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures the recipient can handle the token. The same ownership checks apply, with updates to the token counts.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the state variables are correctly manipulated according to the function's logic. 

### Important Note:
Make sure to replace any placeholder variables or expressions (like `_oldCountFrom`) with actual logic or state references that you maintain in your implementation, as they are not explicitly defined in the provided interface.
