    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned is equal to the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner address matches the address that owns the token.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is correctly set.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the token.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the operator approval status is correctly set for the caller.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored operator approval.
7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the recipient is not the zero address, the caller is either the owner or an approved operator, and updates the ownership and count of NFTs correctly.
8. **safeTransferFrom (two overloads)**: Ensures that the transfer is valid (not to zero address), updates ownership and counts correctly, and verifies that if the recipient is a smart contract, it can handle the NFT. 

These postconditions reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard and ensure consistency across related functions.

Here is the annotated contract with appropriate solc-verify postconditions for each function. I've ensured that the conditions match the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard and that they conform to the guidelines you provided.

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    /// @notice postcondition balance == _ownedTokensCount[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned is equal to the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner address matches the address that owns the token.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is correctly set.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the token.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the operator approval status is correctly set for the caller.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored operator approval.
7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the recipient is not the zero address, the caller is either the owner or an approved operator, and updates the ownership and count of NFTs correctly.
8. **safeTransferFrom (two overloads)**: Ensures that the transfer is valid (not to zero address), updates ownership and counts correctly, and verifies that if the recipient is a smart contract, it can handle the NFT.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are designed to reflect the expected behavior as per the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions for the `safeTransferFrom` function include checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it can handle the NFT transfer, which is a critical aspect of ERC721 compliance. 
- Ensure that the contract's implementation adheres to these specifications for proper functionality and security.

=== USER [2025-03-14 13:13:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned should equal the number of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The owner returned should match the address that owns the specified token.
3. **approve**: The approved address for the specified token ID should be set to the given address.
4. **getApproved**: The approved address returned should match the stored approval for the token.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The operator approval status should reflect the approved status for the specified operator.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status should match the stored operator approval status for the specified owner.
7. **transferFrom**: 
   - The recipient address `_to` should not be the zero address.
   - The caller must be either the owner or an approved operator.
   - The number of NFTs owned by `_from` should decrease by 1, and the number owned by `_to` should increase by 1.
   - The ownership of the token should be updated to `_to`.
8. **safeTransferFrom** (two overloads): 
   - The recipient address `_to` should not be the zero address.
   - The ownership should be updated correctly, and if `_to` is a contract, it should be able to handle the NFT transfer.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure compliance with the ERC721 standard and provide necessary checks for the transfer functions.
- The conditions for `safeTransferFrom` include checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it can handle the NFT transfer, which is crucial for ERC721 compliance. 
- Ensure that the implementation of the contract adheres to these specifications for proper functionality and security.

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the number of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner address matches the address that owns the specified token.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is correctly set.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the operator approval status is set correctly for the specified operator.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored operator approval status for the specified owner.
7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_from` decreases by 1, and the number owned by `_to` increases by 1.
   - Ensures that the ownership of the token is updated to `_to`.
8. **safeTransferFrom** (two overloads):
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the ownership is updated correctly.
   - Ensures that if `_to` is a contract, it can handle the NFT transfer.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure compliance with the ERC721 standard and provide necessary checks for the transfer functions.
- The conditions for `safeTransferFrom` include checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it can handle the NFT transfer, which is crucial for ERC721 compliance.
- Ensure that the implementation of the contract adheres to these specifications for proper functionality and security.

=== USER [2025-03-14 13:15:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned is equal to the number of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner address matches the address that owns the specified token.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is set correctly.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the operator approval status is correctly set for the specified operator.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored operator approval status for the specified owner.
7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_from` decreases by 1, and the number owned by `_to` increases by 1.
   - Ensures that the ownership of the token is updated to `_to`.
8. **safeTransferFrom** (two overloads):
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the ownership is updated correctly.
   - Ensures that if `_to` is a contract, it can handle the NFT transfer.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure compliance with the ERC721 standard and provide necessary checks for the transfer functions.
- The conditions for `safeTransferFrom` include checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it can handle the NFT transfer, which is crucial for ERC721 compliance.
- Ensure that the implementation of the contract adheres to these specifications for proper functionality and security.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the number of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner address corresponds to the address that owns the specified token.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is set correctly.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the operator approval status is correctly set for the specified operator.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored operator approval status for the specified owner.
7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_from` decreases by 1, and the number owned by `_to` increases by 1.
   - Ensures that the ownership of the token is updated to `_to`.
8. **safeTransferFrom** (two overloads):
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the ownership is updated correctly.
   - Ensures that if `_to` is a contract, it can handle the NFT transfer.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure compliance with the ERC721 standard and provide necessary checks for the transfer functions.

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the number of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner address matches the address that owns the specified token.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is set correctly.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the operator approval status is correctly set for the specified operator.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored operator approval status for the specified owner.
7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_from` decreases by 1, and the number owned by `_to` increases by 1.
   - Ensures that the ownership of the token is updated to `_to`.
8. **safeTransferFrom** (two overloads):
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the ownership is updated correctly.
   - Ensures that if `_to` is a contract, it can handle the NFT transfer.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure compliance with the ERC721 standard and provide necessary checks for the transfer functions.
- The conditions for `safeTransferFrom` include checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it can handle the NFT transfer, which is crucial for ERC721 compliance.
- Ensure that the implementation of the contract adheres to these specifications for proper functionality and security.

=== USER [2025-03-14 13:17:57] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the number of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner address matches the address that owns the specified token.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is set correctly.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the operator approval status is correctly set for the specified operator.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored operator approval status for the specified owner.
7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_from` decreases by 1, and the number owned by `_to` increases by 1.
   - Ensures that the ownership of the token is updated to `_to`.
8. **safeTransferFrom** (two overloads):
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the ownership is updated correctly.
   - Ensures that if `_to` is a contract, it can handle the NFT transfer.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure compliance with the ERC721 standard and provide necessary checks for the transfer functions.
- The conditions for `safeTransferFrom` include checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it can handle the NFT transfer, which is crucial for ERC721 compliance.
- Ensure that the implementation of the contract adheres to these specifications for proper functionality and security.

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the number of NFTs owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner address matches the address that owns the specified token.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is set correctly.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the operator approval status is correctly set for the specified operator.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored operator approval status for the specified owner.
7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_from` decreases by 1, and the number owned by `_to` increases by 1.
   - Ensures that the ownership of the token is updated to `_to`.
8. **safeTransferFrom** (two overloads):
   - Ensures that the recipient address `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the ownership is updated correctly.
   - Ensures that if `_to` is a contract, it can handle the NFT transfer.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure compliance with the ERC721 standard and provide necessary checks for the transfer functions.
- The conditions for `safeTransferFrom` include checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it can handle the NFT transfer, which is crucial for ERC721 compliance.
- Ensure that the implementation of the contract adheres to these specifications for proper functionality and security.
