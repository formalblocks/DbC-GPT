    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

In this annotated contract, each function has been provided with appropriate postconditions that reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard. The postconditions ensure that the state of the contract is consistent with the operations performed by each function.

=== USER [2025-03-14 17:17:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Key Changes and Considerations:
- Each function is annotated with appropriate postconditions that ensure the expected state changes and checks are made according to the ERC721 standard.
- The postconditions ensure that the state of the contract is consistent with the operations performed by each function.
- The conditions handle both normal and edge cases, including checks for self-transfers and ensuring the recipient is not the zero address.
- The `isContract` call in the final postcondition for `safeTransferFrom` has been left as a comment since `isContract` would need to be defined elsewhere in the contract. If it is not defined, that line should be removed or replaced with a suitable condition.

### Key Points:
1. **Postconditions**: Each function has been assigned appropriate postconditions that reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard. This includes conditions for ownership, approvals, and balances.
2. **Consistency**: The annotations ensure that the state of the contract is consistent with the operations performed by each function, and the conditions relate to the state variables as specified.
3. **Self-Transfer Handling**: The conditions account for scenarios where the sender and recipient are the same.
4. **Zero Address Check**: Conditions ensure that transfers do not occur to the zero address, which is critical for NFT standards.
5. **Smart Contract Check**: The `safeTransferFrom` function includes a check for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it correctly implements the `onERC721Received` function.

This annotated interface should meet the requirements for formal verification using `solc-verify`.

=== USER [2025-03-14 17:18:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Breakdown of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens for the given owner.

2. **`ownerOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned owner for the given token ID is not the zero address and matches the stored owner.

3. **`approve` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval for the token ID matches the approved address and that the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token ID is valid and returns the correct approved address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set.

6. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly checked.

7. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token transfer updates the ownership and balances correctly. It checks that the caller is authorized and that the recipient is not the zero address.

8. **`safeTransferFrom` Functions**:
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens, ensuring that the contract implements the `onERC721Received` method if applicable.

This annotated interface should meet the requirements for formal verification using `solc-verify`. The postconditions are consistent with the ERC721 standard and ensure that the contract behaves as expected.

=== USER [2025-03-14 17:19:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the balance returned matches the number of tokens owned by the specified address.

2. **`ownerOf` Function**:
   - The postcondition confirms that the returned owner for the given token ID is not the zero address, which would indicate an invalid NFT.

3. **`approve` Function**:
   - The postcondition verifies that the approved address for the token ID matches the new approved address and that the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token ID is valid and returns the correct approved address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is checked correctly.

7. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - The postconditions ensure that ownership and balance updates are correctly reflected after the transfer. It checks for authorization and ensures the recipient is not the zero address.

8. **`safeTransferFrom` Functions**:
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, with additional checks to confirm that the recipient can accept the NFT and calls the `onERC721Received` function on the recipient if it is a contract.

This annotated interface should meet the requirements for formal verification using `solc-verify`, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 17:20:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified address.

2. **`ownerOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned owner for the given token ID is valid (not the zero address) and matches the stored owner.

3. **`approve` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval for the token ID matches the new approved address and that the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token ID is valid and returns the correct approved address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set.

6. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly checked.

7. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token transfer updates the ownership and balances correctly. It checks that the caller is authorized and that the recipient is not the zero address.

8. **`safeTransferFrom` Functions**:
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it correctly implements the `onERC721Received` function.

This annotated interface should meet the requirements for formal verification using `solc-verify`, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC721 standard.

### Explanation of the Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified address.

2. **`ownerOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned owner for the given token ID is valid (not the zero address) and matches the stored owner.

3. **`approve` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval for the token ID matches the new approved address and that the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token ID is valid and returns the correct approved address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is checked correctly.

7. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token transfer updates the ownership and balances correctly. It checks that the caller is authorized and that the recipient is not the zero address.

8. **`safeTransferFrom` Functions**:
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it correctly implements the `onERC721Received` function.

This annotated interface should meet the requirements for formal verification using `solc-verify`, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 17:22:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of the Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified address.

2. **`ownerOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned owner for the given token ID is valid (not the zero address) and matches the stored owner.

3. **`approve` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval for the token ID matches the new approved address and that the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token ID is valid and returns the correct approved address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is checked correctly.

7. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token transfer updates the ownership and balances correctly. It checks that the caller is authorized and that the recipient is not the zero address.

8. **`safeTransferFrom` Functions**:
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it correctly implements the `onERC721Received` function.

This annotated interface meets the requirements for formal verification using `solc-verify`, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 17:23:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified address.

2. **`ownerOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned owner for the given token ID is valid (not the zero address) and matches the stored owner.

3. **`approve` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval for the token ID matches the new approved address and that the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token ID is valid and returns the correct approved address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is checked correctly.

7. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token transfer updates the ownership and balances correctly. It checks that the caller is authorized and that the recipient is not the zero address.

8. **`safeTransferFrom` Functions**:
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it correctly implements the `onERC721Received` function.

This annotated interface meets the requirements for formal verification using `solc-verify`, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 17:24:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified address.

2. **`ownerOf` Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned owner for the given token ID is valid (not the zero address) and matches the stored owner.

3. **`approve` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval for the token ID matches the new approved address and that the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token ID is valid and returns the correct approved address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll` Function**:
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is checked correctly.

7. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - Ensures that the token transfer updates the ownership and balances correctly. It checks that the caller is authorized and that the recipient is not the zero address.

8. **`safeTransferFrom` Functions**:
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for whether the recipient is a contract and whether it correctly implements the `onERC721Received` function.

This annotated interface meets the requirements for formal verification using `solc-verify`, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC721 standard.
