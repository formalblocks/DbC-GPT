=== USER [2025-03-14 12:04:18] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified address.

2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the owner of the specified token ID is returned correctly and that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **`approve`**: Validates that the approved address for the specified token ID is updated correctly.

4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is returned and that the token is valid.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is correctly set.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Checks that the approval status for the operator is returned accurately.

7. **`transferFrom`**: 
   - Validates the change in ownership of the token, including the counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient.
   - Handles the case where the sender and recipient are the same.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, it ensures proper ownership transfer and updates the counts, while also validating the recipient's capability to receive tokens.

9. **`safeTransferFrom` with data**: Mirrors the logic of the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring consistent behavior with the addition of handling data.

These annotations ensure that the expected behavior of the ERC721 standard is maintained and formally verified.

Here is the annotated contract with appropriate solc-verify postconditions for each function, based on the ERC721 standard. The postconditions are designed to ensure the expected behavior of the contract functions and adhere to the guidelines provided.

```solidity

contract IERC721 {

    bytes4 private constant _ERC721_RECEIVED = 0x150b7a02;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    function balanceOf(address _owner) external view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition ( (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1 && _from != _to) || (_from == _to) )

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice postcondition ( (_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1 && _from != _to) || (_from == _to) )
    /// @notice postcondition ( (_ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1 && _from != _to) || (_from == _to) )

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the returned balance equals the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.

2. **`ownerOf`**: Validates that the owner of the specified token ID is returned correctly and that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **`approve`**: Confirms that the approved address for the specified token ID is updated correctly.

4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is returned and that the token is valid.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is correctly set.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is returned accurately.

7. **`transferFrom`**: 
   - Validates the change in ownership of the token, including the counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient.
   - Handles the case where the sender and recipient are the same.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, it ensures proper ownership transfer and updates the counts, while also validating the recipient's capability to receive tokens.

9. **`safeTransferFrom` with data**: Mirrors the logic of the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring consistent behavior with the addition of handling data.

### Addressing Compiler Warnings and Errors:
- Ensure that the identifiers used in the postconditions are correct and match the state variables as declared in the contract.
- If there are any warnings or errors related to undeclared identifiers, double-check the variable names and ensure they are used consistently.

### Note:
Make sure to run the contract through the compiler and verification tool again after these changes to ensure that all annotations are correctly interpreted and that there are no further errors.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:05:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - Ensures that the balance returned matches the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.

2. **`ownerOf`**: 
   - Confirms that the owner of the specified token ID is returned correctly and that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **`approve`**: 
   - Validates that the approved address for the specified token ID is updated correctly.

4. **`getApproved`**: 
   - Ensures that the approved address for the specified token ID is returned and that the token is valid.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is correctly set.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - Checks that the approval status for the operator is returned accurately.

7. **`transferFrom`**: 
   - Validates the change in ownership of the token, including the counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient.
   - Handles the case where the sender and recipient are the same.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, it ensures proper ownership transfer and updates the counts, while also validating the recipient's capability to receive tokens.

9. **`safeTransferFrom` with data**: 
   - Mirrors the logic of the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring consistent behavior with the addition of handling data.

### Handling Compiler Warnings and Errors:
- Ensure that the identifiers used in the postconditions are correct and match the state variables as declared in the contract.
- If there are any warnings or errors related to undeclared identifiers, double-check the variable names and ensure they are used consistently.

### Note:
Make sure to run the contract through the compiler and verification tool again after these changes to ensure that all annotations are correctly interpreted and that there are no further errors. If you encounter specific errors, please share them for further assistance.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by the `_owner` matches the returned `balance`.

2. **`ownerOf`**: 
   - Ensures that the returned `_owner` of the specified `_tokenId` is valid and not the zero address.

3. **`approve`**: 
   - Confirms that the approved address for the specified `_tokenId` matches the `_approved` address.

4. **`getApproved`**: 
   - Ensures that the approved address for the specified `_tokenId` is returned correctly and that the token is valid.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - Validates that the approval status for the `_operator` is set correctly based on the caller's action.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - Confirms that the approval status for the `_operator` is returned accurately.

7. **`transferFrom`**: 
   - Validates that the ownership of the token is transferred correctly, including the updates to the counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient.
   - Handles the case where the sender and recipient are the same.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, it ensures proper ownership transfer and updates the counts, while also validating the recipient's capability to receive tokens.

9. **`safeTransferFrom` with data**: 
   - Mirrors the logic of the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring consistent behavior with the addition of handling data.

### Handling Compiler Warnings and Errors:
- Ensure that the identifiers used in the postconditions are correct and match the state variables as declared in the contract.
- If there are any warnings or errors related to undeclared identifiers, double-check the variable names and ensure they are used consistently.

### Note:
Make sure to run the contract through the compiler and verification tool again after these changes to ensure that all annotations are correctly interpreted and that there are no further errors. If you encounter specific errors, please share them for further assistance.
