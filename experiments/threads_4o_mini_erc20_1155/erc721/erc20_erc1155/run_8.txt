=== USER [2025-03-14 16:32:53] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner address is not the zero address and that the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the token ID being queried has a valid owner.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approved address for the token either changes to the new approved address or remains unchanged based on the success of the operation.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

This ensures that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:33:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures the queried owner is not the zero address and that the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures the token ID is valid and that the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval status for the token ID is updated correctly based on the success of the operation.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

This ensures that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:33:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner is not zero and that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures the token ID is valid and that the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval status for the token ID either changes to the new approved address or remains unchanged based on the success of the operation.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

This ensures that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner is not the zero address and that the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the token ID being queried is valid and that the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval status for the token ID is updated correctly based on the success of the operation.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and verifies that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner is not the zero address and confirms that the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the token ID is valid and that the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval status for the token ID is updated correctly based on the success of the operation.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and verifies that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

This structure ensures that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:36:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner is not the zero address and that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the token ID is valid and that the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval status for the token ID is updated correctly based on the operation's success.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and verifies that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner is not the zero address and that the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the token ID is valid and that the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval status for the token ID is updated correctly based on the success of the operation.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and verifies that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

This structure ensures that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:38:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner is not the zero address and that the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the token ID is valid and that the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval status for the token ID is updated correctly based on the success of the operation.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and verifies that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:39:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner is not the zero address and that the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the token ID is valid and that the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval status for the token ID is updated correctly based on the success of the operation.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and verifies that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:40:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the queried owner is not the zero address and that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the token ID is valid and that the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval status for the token ID is updated correctly based on the success of the operation.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the caller is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the operator approval status is returned correctly based on the owner and operator addresses.
7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is updated correctly and that the recipient address is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and verifies that the transfer logic adheres to the ERC721 standard.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is accurately captured and verifiable according to the ERC721 standard.
