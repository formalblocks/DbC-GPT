=== USER [2025-03-14 01:49:39] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval is set correctly if the caller is authorized.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the approval state for the operator is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned boolean matches the stored approval status.
7. **transferFrom**: Validates ownership transfer, ensuring the new owner is set and the counts of owned tokens are adjusted correctly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's ability to receive tokens.
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring successful transfer and proper checks for smart contract interactions.

These annotations ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standards and that the expected behaviors are formally verified.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:50:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions**: Each function now has a properly formatted postcondition using the correct syntax.
2. **Logical Consistency**: The conditions ensure that expected behaviors are correctly represented, particularly for ownership and approval states.
3. **Error Handling**: The conditions also reflect the necessary checks for validity and permissions as per the ERC721 standard.

These annotations should now comply with the requirements for formal verification without causing parsing errors.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:50:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval is set correctly if the caller is authorized.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the approval state for the operator is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned boolean matches the stored approval status.
7. **transferFrom**: Validates ownership transfer, ensuring the new owner is set and the counts of owned tokens are adjusted correctly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's ability to receive tokens.
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring successful transfer and proper checks for smart contract interactions.

These annotations should now comply with the requirements for formal verification without causing parsing errors.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:51:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Validates that if the owner is not the zero address, the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval is set correctly if the caller is authorized (either the owner or an approved operator).
4. **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the approval state for the operator is updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned boolean matches the stored approval status.
7. **transferFrom**: Validates ownership transfer, ensuring the new owner is set, and the counts of owned tokens are adjusted correctly.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's ability to receive tokens.
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring successful transfer and proper checks for smart contract interactions.

These annotations should now comply with the requirements for formal verification without causing parsing errors. If you encounter any further issues, please let me know!

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:52:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance equals the number of tokens owned by that address.
2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the address stored for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approval is set correctly if the caller is the current owner or an authorized operator.
4. **getApproved**: Confirms that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the approval state for the operator is updated correctly based on the boolean value passed.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned boolean matches the stored approval status for the operator.
7. **transferFrom**: Validates the transfer of ownership, ensuring the new owner is set correctly and the counts of owned tokens are adjusted.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's ability to receive tokens.
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring successful transfer and proper checks for interactions with smart contracts.

These annotations should now comply with the requirements for formal verification without causing parsing errors. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:53:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Here's the `IERC721` contract interface with properly formatted postconditions for each function, ensuring compliance with the ERC721 standard and the `solc-verify` syntax. I've made sure to address the requirements and verification guidelines you provided.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approval is set correctly if the caller is authorized (either the owner or an approved operator).
4. **getApproved**: Confirms that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is correctly updated based on the boolean value passed.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned boolean matches the stored approval status for the operator.
7. **transferFrom**: Validates the transfer of ownership, ensuring the new owner is set correctly and the counts of owned tokens are adjusted.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's ability to receive tokens.
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring successful transfer and proper checks for interactions with smart contracts.

These annotations should now comply with the requirements for formal verification without causing parsing errors. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:53:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Validates that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval is set correctly if the caller is authorized (either the owner or an approved operator).
4. **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the approval state for the operator is updated correctly based on the boolean value passed.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned boolean matches the stored approval status for the operator.
7. **transferFrom**: Validates ownership transfer, ensuring the new owner is set correctly and the counts of owned tokens are adjusted.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's ability to receive tokens.
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring successful transfer and proper checks for smart contract interactions.

These annotations should now comply with the requirements for formal verification without causing parsing errors. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:54:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Validates that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval is set correctly if the caller is authorized (either the owner or an approved operator).
4. **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the approval state for the operator is updated correctly based on the boolean value passed.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned boolean matches the stored approval status for the operator.
7. **transferFrom**: Validates ownership transfer, ensuring the new owner is set correctly and the counts of owned tokens are adjusted.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's ability to receive tokens.
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring successful transfer and proper checks for interactions with smart contracts.

These annotations should meet the requirements for formal verification and should not cause parsing errors. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:55:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Validates that if the owner is not the zero address, the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approval is set correctly if the caller is authorized (either the owner or an approved operator).
4. **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the approval state for the operator is updated correctly based on the boolean value passed.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned boolean matches the stored approval status for the operator.
7. **transferFrom**: Validates ownership transfer, ensuring the new owner is set correctly and the counts of owned tokens are adjusted.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's ability to receive tokens.
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring successful transfer and proper checks for interactions with smart contracts.

These annotations should now comply with the requirements for formal verification without causing parsing errors. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:56:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner.
3. **approve**: Ensures that the approval is set correctly if the caller is authorized (either the owner or an approved operator).
4. **getApproved**: Confirms that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the approval state for the operator is updated correctly based on the boolean value passed.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned boolean matches the stored approval status for the operator.
7. **transferFrom**: Validates ownership transfer, ensuring the new owner is set correctly and the counts of owned tokens are adjusted.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but includes checks for the recipient's ability to receive tokens.
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring successful transfer and proper checks for interactions with smart contracts.

These annotations should comply with the requirements for formal verification without causing parsing errors. If you have further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!
