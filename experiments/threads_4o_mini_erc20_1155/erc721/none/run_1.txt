    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the balance is non-negative, reflects the correct count of owned tokens, and is zero for the zero address.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms the returned owner is the actual owner of the token and that a zero token ID returns the zero address.
3. **`approve`**: Verifies that the approval has been set correctly and that the caller is either the owner or authorized.
4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures the returned approved address matches what is stored and that a zero token ID returns the zero address.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms the approval status for an operator is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures the returned value matches the expected approval status.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly, and checks that the sender is authorized.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for safe transfer conditions, including the contract's capability to receive the token.
9. **The second `safeTransferFrom`**: This function includes additional data but maintains the same postconditions as the first `safeTransferFrom`.

This ensures that all postconditions are aligned with the expected behavior of the ERC721 standard.

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative.
   - Confirms the balance matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
   - If the owner is the zero address, the balance should be zero.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that the returned owner is the actual owner of the token.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Verifies that the approval is set correctly for the token.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensures the returned value matches the expected approval status.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the sender is authorized.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`** (first version):
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the token.

9. **`safeTransferFrom`** (second version):
   - Similar to the first `safeTransferFrom`, but includes a data parameter and checks for the recipient's capability to receive the token.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are consistent and reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions are structured to avoid introducing intermediate variables or statements, adhering to the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:19:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative.
   - Confirms that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
   - If the owner is the zero address, the balance must be zero.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that the returned owner matches the actual owner of the token.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Verifies that the approval is correctly set for the token.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensures the returned value matches the expected approval status.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the sender is authorized.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`** (first version):
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the token.

9. **`safeTransferFrom`** (second version):
   - Similar to the first `safeTransferFrom`, but includes a data parameter and checks for the recipient's capability to receive the token.

### Notes:
- The postconditions are consistent and reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions are structured to avoid introducing intermediate variables or statements, adhering to the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:20:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

   - Ensures the balance is non-negative.
   - Confirms the balance matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
   - If the owner is the zero address, the balance must be zero.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that the returned owner matches the actual owner of the token.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Verifies that the approval is correctly set for the token.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensures the returned value matches the expected approval status.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the sender is authorized.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`** (first version):
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the token.

9. **`safeTransferFrom`** (second version):
   - Similar to the first `safeTransferFrom`, but includes a data parameter and checks for the recipient's capability to receive the token.

### Notes:
- The postconditions reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions are structured to avoid introducing intermediate variables or statements, adhering to the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:20:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the balance is non-negative.
   - Confirms that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
   - If the owner is the zero address, the balance must be zero.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that the returned owner matches the actual owner of the token.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Verifies that the approval is correctly set for the token.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Ensures that the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensures that the returned value matches the expected approval status.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the sender is authorized.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`** (first version):
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the token.

9. **`safeTransferFrom`** (second version):
   - Similar to the first `safeTransferFrom`, but includes a data parameter and checks for the recipient's capability to receive the token.

### Notes:
- The postconditions reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions are structured to avoid introducing intermediate variables or statements, adhering to the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:21:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the balance is non-negative.
   - Confirms that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
   - If the owner is the zero address, the balance must be zero.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that the returned owner matches the actual owner of the token.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Verifies that the approval is correctly set for the token.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Ensures that the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensures that the returned value matches the expected approval status.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the sender is authorized.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`** (first version):
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the token.

9. **`safeTransferFrom`** (second version):
   - Similar to the first `safeTransferFrom`, but includes a data parameter and checks for the recipient's capability to receive the token.

### Notes:
- The postconditions reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions are structured to avoid introducing intermediate variables or statements, adhering to the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:22:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the balance is non-negative.
   - Confirms that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
   - If the owner is the zero address, the balance must be zero.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that the returned owner matches the actual owner of the token.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Verifies that the approval is correctly set for the token.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Ensures that the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensures that the returned value matches the expected approval status.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the sender is authorized.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`** (first version):
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the token.

9. **`safeTransferFrom`** (second version):
   - Similar to the first `safeTransferFrom`, but includes a data parameter and checks for the recipient's capability to receive the token.

### Notes:
- The postconditions reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions are structured to avoid introducing intermediate variables or statements, adhering to the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:23:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative.
   - Confirms the balance matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
   - If the owner is the zero address, the balance must be zero.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that the returned owner matches the actual owner of the token.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Verifies that the approval is correctly set for the token.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensures the returned value matches the expected approval status.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the sender is authorized.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`** (first version):
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the token.

9. **`safeTransferFrom`** (second version):
   - Similar to the first `safeTransferFrom`, but includes a data parameter and checks for the recipient's capability to receive the token.

### Notes:
- The postconditions reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions are structured to avoid introducing intermediate variables or statements, adhering to the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:24:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the balance is non-negative.
   - Confirms that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
   - If the owner is the zero address, the balance must be zero.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that the returned owner matches the actual owner of the token.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Verifies that the approval is correctly set for the token.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Ensures that the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensures that the returned value matches the expected approval status.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the sender is authorized.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`** (first version):
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the token.

9. **`safeTransferFrom`** (second version):
   - Similar to the first `safeTransferFrom`, but includes a data parameter and checks for the recipient's capability to receive the token.

### Notes:
- The postconditions reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions are structured to avoid introducing intermediate variables or statements, adhering to the guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:25:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the balance is non-negative.
   - Confirms that the balance returned matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
   - If the owner is the zero address, the balance must be zero.

2. **`ownerOf`**:
   - Confirms that the returned owner matches the actual owner of the token.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

3. **`approve`**:
   - Verifies that the approval is correctly set for the token.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator.

4. **`getApproved`**:
   - Ensures that the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
   - If the token ID is zero, it should return the zero address.

5. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

6. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Ensures that the returned value matches the expected approval status.

7. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the sender is authorized.

8. **`safeTransferFrom`** (first version):
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, but ensures that the recipient is capable of receiving the token.

9. **`safeTransferFrom`** (second version):
   - Similar to the first `safeTransferFrom`, but includes a data parameter and checks for the recipient's capability to receive the token.

### Notes:
- The postconditions reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
- The conditions are structured to avoid introducing intermediate variables or statements, adhering to the guidelines provided.
