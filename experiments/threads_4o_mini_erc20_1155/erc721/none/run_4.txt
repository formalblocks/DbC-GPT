=== USER [2025-03-14 01:41:09] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned is the same as the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: Confirms that the owner returned for the given token ID matches the stored owner in the mapping.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approved address is correctly set in the mapping after the function execution.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures the returned approved address matches the mapping for the given token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the approval status for the operator is correctly updated.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Verifies the approval status in the mapping matches the expected return.
7. **transferFrom**: Confirms the ownership is transferred correctly and that the new owner is not the zero address.
8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensures that the ownership is transferred correctly and checks that the new owner is not the zero address. The conditions account for the requirement that the recipient must be capable of receiving NFTs. 

These postconditions are designed to ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of the token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:41:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The balance should always be non-negative.
   - The balance returned should match the count of tokens owned by the specified address.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - The owner returned for the specified token ID must match the owner stored in the mapping.

3. **approve**: 
   - If the approved address is set to zero, the corresponding mapping entry must also be zero. If it is set to a non-zero address, that address must match the mapping entry.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - The approved address returned for the specified token ID must match the corresponding mapping entry.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status for the operator should reflect the value passed to the function.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The return value should match the stored approval status in the operator approvals mapping.

7. **transferFrom**: 
   - After the transfer, the owner of the token should be updated to the new owner and should not be zero. If the transfer is to zero, the previous owner must remain unchanged.

8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, the ownership should be transferred correctly, and the checks for zero address should apply.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:42:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The balance returned is always non-negative and matches the count of tokens owned by the specified address.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - The owner returned for the specified token ID matches the owner stored in the mapping.

3. **approve**: 
   - If the approved address is set to zero, the corresponding mapping entry must also be zero. If it is set to a non-zero address, that address must match the mapping entry.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - The approved address returned for the specified token ID matches the corresponding mapping entry.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status for the operator reflects the value passed to the function.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The return value matches the stored approval status in the operator approvals mapping.

7. **transferFrom**: 
   - After the transfer, the owner of the token is updated to the new owner and should not be zero. If the transfer is to zero, the previous owner remains unchanged.

8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, the ownership is transferred correctly, and checks for zero address apply.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:43:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the number of tokens owned by the specified address, which is tracked in `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - The owner returned for the specified token ID must match the address stored in the `_tokenOwner` mapping.

3. **approve**: 
   - If the approved address is set to zero, the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals` must also be zero. If a non-zero address is approved, it must match the value in `_tokenApprovals`.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - The approved address returned for the specified token ID must match the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function, as indicated by the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The return value must match the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom**: 
   - After the transfer, the owner of the token must be updated to the new owner, and it should not be zero. If the transfer is to zero, the previous owner must remain unchanged.

8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, the ownership must be transferred correctly, and checks for the zero address must apply. The function should also ensure that if the recipient is a contract, it can handle the incoming NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:43:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the number of tokens owned by the specified address, which is tracked in `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - The owner returned for the specified token ID must match the address stored in the `_tokenOwner` mapping.

3. **approve**: 
   - If the approved address is set to zero, the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals` must also be zero. If a non-zero address is approved, it must match the value in `_tokenApprovals`.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - The approved address returned for the specified token ID must match the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function, as indicated by the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The return value must match the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom**: 
   - After the transfer, the owner of the token must be updated to the new owner, and it should not be zero. If the transfer is to zero, the previous owner must remain unchanged.

8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, the ownership must be transferred correctly, and checks for the zero address must apply. The function should also ensure that if the recipient is a contract, it can handle the incoming NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:44:44] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the number of tokens owned by the specified address, which is tracked in `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - The owner returned for the specified token ID must match the address stored in the `_tokenOwner` mapping.

3. **approve**: 
   - If the approved address is set to zero, the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals` must also be zero. If a non-zero address is approved, it must match the value in `_tokenApprovals`.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - The approved address returned for the specified token ID must match the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function, as indicated by the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The return value must match the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom**: 
   - After the transfer, the owner of the token must be updated to the new owner, and it should not be zero. If the transfer is to zero, the previous owner must remain unchanged.

8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, the ownership must be transferred correctly, and checks for the zero address must apply. The function should also ensure that if the recipient is a contract, it can handle the incoming NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:45:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the number of tokens owned by the specified address, which is tracked in `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - The owner returned for the specified token ID must match the address stored in the `_tokenOwner` mapping.

3. **approve**: 
   - If the approved address is set to zero, the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals` must also be zero. If a non-zero address is approved, it must match the value in `_tokenApprovals`.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - The approved address returned for the specified token ID must match the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function, as indicated by the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The return value must match the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom**: 
   - After the transfer, the owner of the token must be updated to the new owner, and it should not be zero. If the transfer is to zero, the previous owner must remain unchanged.

8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, the ownership must be transferred correctly, and checks for the zero address must apply. The function should also ensure that if the recipient is a contract, it can handle the incoming NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the number of tokens owned by the specified address, which is tracked in `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - The owner returned for the specified token ID must match the address stored in the `_tokenOwner` mapping.

3. **approve**: 
   - If the approved address is set to zero, the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals` must also be zero. If a non-zero address is approved, it must match the value in `_tokenApprovals`.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - The approved address returned for the specified token ID must match the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function, as indicated by the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The return value must match the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom**: 
   - After the transfer, the owner of the token must be updated to the new owner, and it should not be zero. If the transfer is to zero, the previous owner must remain unchanged.

8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, the ownership must be transferred correctly, and checks for the zero address must apply. The function should also ensure that if the recipient is a contract, it can handle the incoming NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the number of tokens owned by the specified address, which is tracked in `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - The owner returned for the specified token ID must match the address stored in the `_tokenOwner` mapping.

3. **approve**: 
   - If the approved address is set to zero, the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals` must also be zero. If a non-zero address is approved, it must match the value in `_tokenApprovals`.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - The approved address returned for the specified token ID must match the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function, as indicated by the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The return value must match the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom**: 
   - After the transfer, the owner of the token must be updated to the new owner, and it should not be zero. If the transfer is to zero, the previous owner must remain unchanged.

8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, the ownership must be transferred correctly, and checks for the zero address must apply. The function should also ensure that if the recipient is a contract, it can handle the incoming NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the number of tokens owned by the specified address, which is tracked in `_ownedTokensCount`.

2. **ownerOf**: 
   - The owner returned for the specified token ID must match the address stored in the `_tokenOwner` mapping.

3. **approve**: 
   - If the approved address is set to zero, the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals` must also be zero. If a non-zero address is approved, it must match the value in `_tokenApprovals`.

4. **getApproved**: 
   - The approved address returned for the specified token ID must match the corresponding entry in `_tokenApprovals`.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function, as indicated by the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The return value must match the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

7. **transferFrom**: 
   - After the transfer, the owner of the token must be updated to the new owner, and it should not be zero. If the transfer is to zero, the previous owner must remain unchanged.

8. **safeTransferFrom (both overloads)**: 
   - Similar to `transferFrom`, the ownership must be transferred correctly, and checks for the zero address must apply. The function should also ensure that if the recipient is a contract, it can handle the incoming NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.
