=== USER [2025-03-14 02:15:02] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Function**: Ensures the balance returned is non-negative and matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **Owner Function**: Confirms the returned owner is the current owner of the token and not the zero address.
3. **Approve Function**: Ensures that the approved address is set correctly and that it can be set to zero.
4. **Get Approved Function**: Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
5. **Set Approval for All Function**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.
6. **Is Approved for All Function**: Ensures the return value reflects the current approval status.
7. **Transfer From Function**: Validates that ownership is transferred correctly and that the token counts are updated.
8. **Safe Transfer From Functions**: Similar to the transfer function with additional checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens, including the safe transfer checks.

These postconditions reflect the expected behavior of each function according to the ERC721 standard and ensure consistency across related functions.

=== USER [2025-03-14 02:15:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Function**: Ensures the balance returned is non-negative and matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **Owner Function**: Confirms the returned owner is the current owner of the token and not the zero address.
3. **Approve Function**: Ensures that the approved address is set correctly and that it can be set to zero.
4. **Get Approved Function**: Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored approval.
5. **Set Approval for All Function**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.
6. **Is Approved for All Function**: Ensures the return value reflects the current approval status.
7. **Transfer From Function**: Validates that ownership is transferred correctly and that the token counts are updated.
8. **Safe Transfer From Functions**: Similar to the transfer function with additional checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens, including the checks for the successful execution of the `onERC721Received` function.

These postconditions are designed to ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and maintains consistency across its functions.

=== USER [2025-03-14 02:16:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Function**: Ensures the balance returned is non-negative and equals the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
2. **Owner Function**: Confirms that the returned owner matches the stored owner for the specified token ID and that the owner is not the zero address.
3. **Approve Function**: Validates that the approved address for the token ID is set correctly and can be set to zero.
4. **Get Approved Function**: Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.
5. **Set Approval for All Function**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly in the mapping.
6. **Is Approved for All Function**: Confirms that the return value indicates whether the specified operator is approved for the specified owner.
7. **Transfer From Function**: Validates that ownership is transferred correctly, and the token counts are updated appropriately for both the sender and the recipient.
8. **Safe Transfer From Functions**: Similar to the transfer function but includes additional checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and ensures the correct handling of the `onERC721Received` callback.

These postconditions are structured to meet the requirements of the ERC721 standard and ensure that the contract's functions behave as expected.

=== USER [2025-03-14 02:17:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Function**: Ensures the return value is non-negative and corresponds to the number of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **Owner Function**: Confirms that the returned owner matches the stored owner for the specified token ID and that the owner is not the zero address.
3. **Approve Function**: Validates that the approved address for the token ID is set correctly and can be set to the zero address.
4. **Get Approved Function**: Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.
5. **Set Approval for All Function**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly in the mapping.
6. **Is Approved for All Function**: Confirms that the return value indicates whether the specified operator is approved for the specified owner.
7. **Transfer From Function**: Validates that ownership is transferred correctly, and the token counts are updated appropriately for both the sender and the recipient.
8. **Safe Transfer From Functions**: Similar to the transfer function but includes additional checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and ensures the correct handling of the `onERC721Received` callback.

These postconditions are structured to meet the requirements of the ERC721 standard and ensure that the contract's functions behave as expected.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Function**: Ensures the balance returned is non-negative and matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.
2. **Owner Function**: Confirms that the returned owner is the current owner of the token and not the zero address.
3. **Approve Function**: Validates that the approved address for the token ID is set correctly and can be set to zero.
4. **Get Approved Function**: Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.
5. **Set Approval for All Function**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly in the mapping.
6. **Is Approved for All Function**: Confirms that the return value indicates whether the specified operator is approved for the specified owner.
7. **Transfer From Function**: Validates that ownership is transferred correctly and that the token counts are updated appropriately for both the sender and the recipient.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Function**: 
   - Ensures the balance returned is non-negative and matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.

2. **Owner Function**: 
   - Confirms that the returned owner is the current owner of the token and that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **Approve Function**: 
   - Validates that the approved address for the token ID is set correctly and can be set to zero address.

4. **Get Approved Function**: 
   - Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **Set Approval for All Function**: 
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly in the mapping.

6. **Is Approved for All Function**: 
   - Confirms that the return value indicates whether the specified operator is approved for the specified owner.

7. **Transfer From Function**: 
   - Validates that ownership is transferred correctly, and the token counts are updated appropriately for both the sender and the recipient.

8. **Safe Transfer From Functions**: 
   - Similar to the transfer function but includes additional checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and ensures the correct handling of the `onERC721Received` callback.

These postconditions are structured to meet the requirements of the ERC721 standard and ensure that the contract's functions behave as expected.

=== USER [2025-03-14 02:19:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Function**: 
   - Ensures the balance returned is non-negative and matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.

2. **Owner Function**: 
   - Confirms that the returned owner is the current owner of the token and that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **Approve Function**: 
   - Validates that the approved address for the token ID is set correctly and can be set to zero.

4. **Get Approved Function**: 
   - Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **Set Approval for All Function**: 
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly in the mapping.

6. **Is Approved for All Function**: 
   - Confirms that the return value indicates whether the specified operator is approved for the specified owner.

7. **Transfer From Function**: 
   - Validates that ownership is transferred correctly and that the token counts are updated appropriately for both the sender and the recipient.

8. **Safe Transfer From Functions**: 
   - Similar to the transfer function but includes additional checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and ensures the correct handling of the `onERC721Received` callback.

These postconditions are structured to meet the requirements of the ERC721 standard and ensure that the contract's functions behave as expected.

=== USER [2025-03-14 02:20:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Function**: 
   - Ensures that the balance returned is non-negative and matches the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.

2. **Owner Function**: 
   - Confirms that the returned owner is the current owner of the token and that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **Approve Function**: 
   - Validates that the approved address for the token ID is set correctly and can be set to the zero address.

4. **Get Approved Function**: 
   - Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **Set Approval for All Function**: 
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly in the mapping.

6. **Is Approved for All Function**: 
   - Confirms that the return value indicates whether the specified operator is approved for the specified owner.

7. **Transfer From Function**: 
   - Validates that ownership is transferred correctly and that the token counts are updated appropriately for both the sender and the recipient.

8. **Safe Transfer From Functions**: 
   - Similar to the transfer function but includes additional checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and ensures the correct handling of the `onERC721Received` callback.

These postconditions are structured to meet the requirements of the ERC721 standard and ensure that the contract's functions behave as expected.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Function**: 
   - Ensures the balance returned is non-negative and equals the count of owned tokens for the specified owner.

2. **Owner Function**: 
   - Confirms that the returned owner is the current owner of the token and that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **Approve Function**: 
   - Validates that the approved address for the token ID is set correctly and can be set to zero.

4. **Get Approved Function**: 
   - Confirms that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **Set Approval for All Function**: 
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly in the mapping.

6. **Is Approved for All Function**: 
   - Confirms that the return value indicates whether the specified operator is approved for the specified owner.

7. **Transfer From Function**: 
   - Validates that ownership is transferred correctly and that the token counts are updated appropriately for both the sender and the recipient.

8. **Safe Transfer From Functions**: 
   - Similar to the transfer function but includes additional checks for the recipient's capability to receive tokens and ensures the correct handling of the `onERC721Received` callback.

These postconditions are structured to meet the requirements of the ERC721 standard and ensure that the contract's functions behave as expected.
