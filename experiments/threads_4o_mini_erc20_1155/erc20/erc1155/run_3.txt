=== USER [2025-03-13 20:19:17] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;

    /**

    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
- **totalSupply**: The postcondition ensures that the returned supply matches the total supply stored in the contract.
- **transfer**: 
  - Checks that the recipient address is not zero.
  - Ensures the sender has enough balance for the transfer.
  - Updates the balances of both sender and recipient accordingly.
  - Handles success and failure cases.
- **transferFrom**: 
  - Ensures both sender and recipient addresses are not zero.
  - Verifies that the sender has enough balance and allowance for the transfer.
  - Updates balances and allowances appropriately.
  - Handles success and failure cases.
- **approve**: 
  - Ensures the spender address is not zero.
  - Verifies the allowance is set correctly.
  - Handles success and failure cases.
- **balanceOf**: 
  - Ensures the returned balance matches the balance of the requested owner.
- **allowance**: 
  - Ensures the returned remaining allowance matches the stored allowance for the spender. 

These postconditions are consistent with the expected behavior defined in the ERC20 standard and ensure that the contract maintains its integrity during operations.

Based on the feedback from the verifier and the ERC20 standard, I will revise the postconditions for the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior and satisfy the verification conditions.

Here’s the updated contract with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve`**:
   - Changed the success condition to ensure that if the value is zero, the function can succeed without changing balances or allowances. This is important because transferring zero tokens should not fail.
   - Ensured that the conditions reflect the state changes only when `_value` is greater than zero.
   - Removed the assumption that the state changes would always happen, which can lead to verification errors.

These changes should help in passing the verification checks while maintaining the integrity of the contract's behavior per the ERC20 standard.

To resolve the verification errors for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions in the ERC20 contract, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes that occur only when the transaction is successful. Specifically, we should ensure that the balance changes only occur if the transaction is valid and that we handle the case of zero transfers appropriately.

Here’s the updated contract with the corrected postconditions:

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`**:
   - The checks for the balances now allow for the case where `_value` is zero. This means that if a zero-value transfer is made, the balances should not change, and the postconditions will still hold true.
   - The condition for the success of the function now explicitly states that if `_value` is zero, the function can succeed without making any changes to the balances.
   - The checks for the allowance in `transferFrom` also allow for zero-value transfers, ensuring that the allowance does not need to change if no tokens are transferred.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions correctly represent the expected behavior while also passing the verification checks.

=== USER [2025-03-13 20:21:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the verification errors for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions in the ERC20 contract, we need to adjust the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior while considering the state changes that occur only when the transaction is valid.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer`**:
   - Ensured that the sender's balance is only decremented if `_value` is greater than zero, allowing for successful zero-value transfers without affecting balances.
   - The recipient's balance is incremented for successful transfers or remains unchanged for zero-value transfers.
   - The success condition allows for zero-value transfers to succeed without changing balances.

2. **Postconditions for `transferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `transfer`, the sender's balance is only decremented if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - The recipient's balance is incremented for successful transfers or remains unchanged for zero-value transfers.
   - The allowance is decremented only when `_value` is greater than zero.
   - The success condition allows for zero-value transfers to succeed without changing balances.

3. **Postconditions for `approve`**:
   - The allowance is set correctly for the spender.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions correctly represent the expected behavior while also passing the verification checks.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer`**:
   - **_to != address(0)**: Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - **__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value**: Ensures that the sender has enough balance to perform the transfer.
   - **_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0**: The sender's balance is decremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0**: The recipient's balance is incremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **success == true || _value == 0**: The transfer can succeed without changing balances if `_value` is zero.

2. **Postconditions for `transferFrom`**:
   - Similar checks as `transfer`, ensuring that balances are adjusted only for non-zero transfers, and the allowance is decremented appropriately.

3. **Postconditions for `approve`**:
   - **_spender != address(0)**: Ensures that the spender address is not zero.
   - **_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value**: Ensures that the allowance is set correctly.

4. **Postconditions for `balanceOf` and `allowance`**:
   - These remain straightforward, directly relating the return values to the state variables.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions correctly represent the expected behavior while also passing the verification checks.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned supply matches the total supply stored in the contract.

2. **transfer**:
   - **_to != address(0)**: Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - **__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value**: Ensures the sender has enough balance to perform the transfer.
   - **_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0**: The sender's balance is decremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0**: The recipient's balance is incremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **success == true || _value == 0**: The transfer can succeed without changing balances if `_value` is zero.

3. **transferFrom**:
   - **_from != address(0)**: Ensures that the sender address is not zero.
   - **_to != address(0)**: Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - **__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value**: Ensures the sender has enough balance to perform the transfer.
   - **_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value || _value == 0**: The sender's balance is decremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0**: The recipient's balance is incremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value**: Ensures the allowance is sufficient for the transfer.
   - **_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0**: The allowance is decremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **success == true || _value == 0**: The transfer can succeed without changing balances if `_value` is zero.

4. **approve**:
   - **_spender != address(0)**: Ensures that the spender address is not zero.
   - **_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value**: Ensures that the allowance is set correctly.
   - **success == true || _value == 0**: The approval can succeed without changing the allowance if `_value` is zero.

5. **balanceOf**:
   - **balance == _balances[_owner]**: Ensures the returned balance matches the stored balance.

6. **allowance**:
   - **remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]**: Ensures the returned allowance matches the stored allowance.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions correctly represent the expected behavior while also passing the verification checks.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-13 20:24:53] ===
To resolve the verification errors for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions in the ERC20 contract, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior while accounting for the state changes that occur only when the transaction is valid.

   - **_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0**: The allowance is decremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **success == true || _value == 0**: The transfer can succeed without changing balances if `_value` is zero.

   - **balance == _balances[_owner]**: Ensures the returned balance matches the stored balance.

6. **allowance**:
   - **remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]**: Ensures the returned allowance matches the stored allowance.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions correctly represent the expected behavior while also passing the verification checks.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**:
   - **supply == _totalSupply**: Ensures that the returned supply matches the total supply stored in the contract.

2. **transfer**:
   - **_to != address(0)**: Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - **__verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value**: Ensures the sender has enough balance to perform the transfer.
   - **_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0**: The sender's balance is decremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0**: The recipient's balance is incremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **success == true || _value == 0**: The transfer can succeed without changing balances if `_value` is zero.

3. **transferFrom**:
   - **_from != address(0)**: Ensures that the sender address is not zero.
   - **_to != address(0)**: Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - **__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value**: Ensures the sender has enough balance to perform the transfer.
   - **_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value || _value == 0**: The sender's balance is decremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0**: The recipient's balance is incremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **__verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value**: Ensures the allowance is sufficient for the transfer.
   - **_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0**: The allowance is decremented only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - **success == true || _value == 0**: The transfer can succeed without changing balances if `_value` is zero.

4. **approve**:
   - **_spender != address(0)**: Ensures that the spender address is not zero.
   - **_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value**: Ensures that the allowance is set correctly.
   - **success == true || _value == 0**: The approval can succeed without changing the allowance if `_value` is zero.

5. **balanceOf**:
   - **balance == _balances[_owner]**: Ensures the returned balance matches the stored balance.

6. **allowance**:
