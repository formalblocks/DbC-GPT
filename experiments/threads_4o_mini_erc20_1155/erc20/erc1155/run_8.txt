=== USER [2025-03-13 16:43:39] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The return value `supply` must equal the total supply of tokens stored in `_totalSupply`.
   
2. **transfer**: 
   - The `_to` address cannot be zero.
   - The sender must have enough balance unless transferring zero tokens.
   - The balances of both sender and receiver must be updated correctly.
   - If the transfer is successful and the value is greater than 0, conditions must hold; otherwise, the success can be false.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Both `_from` and `_to` addresses cannot be zero.
   - The `_from` address must have enough balance and the allowance must be sufficient.
   - Similar to `transfer`, balances must update correctly, and the allowance must decrease appropriately.

4. **approve**: 
   - The allowance for the `_spender` must be set to the specified `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: 
   - The returned `balance` must match the balance of the specified `_owner`.

6. **allowance**: 
   - The returned `remaining` must match the amount allowed for `_spender` to withdraw from `_owner`. 

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and maintains correct state transitions.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-13 16:44:50] ===
Based on the feedback from the verifier, it appears there are issues with the postconditions for the `transfer`, `approve`, and `transferFrom` functions, specifically regarding the handling of success conditions. Let's revise the postconditions accordingly, ensuring that they accurately reflect the expected behavior and handle success and failure cases appropriately.

Here is the corrected ERC20 contract interface with the updated postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **transfer**:
   - The postconditions ensure that when `_value` is greater than 0, the balances of the sender and receiver are updated correctly. The check for `_to` being non-zero is maintained.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Similar to `transfer`, it ensures that the balances and allowances are updated correctly, and checks are in place for when `_value` is zero or greater.

3. **approve**:
   - The postcondition now states that the allowance for the `_spender` is set to `_value` and the success condition checks for `_value` being non-negative.

These adjustments should resolve the issues flagged by the verifier, ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-13 16:45:23] ===
To address the issues reported by the verifier regarding the postconditions in the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions, we need to refine the conditions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 standard. Specifically, we need to ensure that the postconditions correctly handle the success and failure cases, especially when dealing with zero-value transfers and allowances.

Here’s the updated ERC20 contract interface with properly defined postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **transfer**:
   - Added a condition to ensure `_to` is not the zero address.
   - The success condition now checks that if `_value` is greater than 0, the sender has sufficient balance. If `success` is true, the balance changes are reflected correctly; otherwise, it allows for the possibility of a failed transaction.
   - The conditions ensure that balances are updated correctly and handle the case of transferring zero tokens.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - Similar adjustments as in `transfer`, ensuring that `_from` and `_to` are valid addresses.
   - The condition checks for sufficient balance and allowance when `_value` is greater than 0 and ensures proper updates to balances and allowances.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensured that `_spender` is not the zero address.
   - The postcondition confirms that the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`.

These adjustments should help resolve the errors flagged by the verifier, ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions while adhering to the specified verification guidelines.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **transfer**:
   - **Postcondition for `_to`**: Ensures that the `_to` address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: Checks that if the transfer is successful, the sender's balance must be sufficient. If it fails, the postcondition allows for that.
   - **Balance Updates**: The balance updates are checked correctly, allowing for zero-value transfers without affecting balances.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - **Postcondition for `_from` and `_to`**: Ensures neither address is zero.
   - **Success Condition**: Checks that the `_from` address has enough balance and that the allowance is sufficient for the transfer to proceed. If it fails, it allows for that.
   - **Balance and Allowance Updates**: Similar to the `transfer` function, it checks that balances are updated correctly, including for zero-value transfers.

3. **approve**:
   - **Postcondition for `_spender`**: Ensures that the `_spender` address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: The allowance is set to the specified `_value`. The condition checks for successful execution.

These changes should resolve the errors flagged by the verifier, ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions while adhering to the specified verification guidelines.

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **transfer**:
   - **Postcondition for `_to`**: Ensures that the `_to` address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: Checks that if the transfer is successful, the sender's balance must be sufficient. If it fails, the postcondition allows for that.
   - **Balance Updates**: The balance updates are checked correctly, allowing for zero-value transfers without affecting balances.

2. **transferFrom**:
   - **Postcondition for `_from` and `_to`**: Ensures neither address is zero.
   - **Success Condition**: Checks that the `_from` address has enough balance and that the allowance is sufficient for the transfer to proceed. If it fails, it allows for that.
   - **Balance and Allowance Updates**: Similar to the `transfer` function, it checks that balances are updated correctly, including for zero-value transfers.

3. **approve**:
   - **Postcondition for `_spender`**: Ensures that the `_spender` address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: The allowance is set to the specified `_value`. The condition checks for successful execution.

These changes should resolve the errors flagged by the verifier, ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions while adhering to the specified verification guidelines.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-13 16:48:30] ===
To address the issues reported by the verifier regarding the postconditions in the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions, we need to ensure that the conditions accurately represent the expected behavior according to the ERC20 standard and handle success and failure cases properly.

Here’s the updated ERC20 contract interface with appropriately defined postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _from != address(0) && _to != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value && __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value) || !success
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value || _value == 0
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _spender != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value >= 0) || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **`totalSupply`**:
   - Postcondition ensures that the returned `supply` matches the total supply stored in `_totalSupply`.

2. **`transfer`**:
   - Postcondition checks that the `_to` address is not zero.
   - The success condition checks that if the transfer is successful, the sender's balance must be sufficient. If it fails, the postcondition allows for that.
   - The balance updates are checked correctly, allowing for zero-value transfers without affecting balances.

3. **`transferFrom`**:
   - Postcondition ensures that `_from` and `_to` addresses are not zero.
   - The success condition checks that the `_from` address has enough balance and the allowance is sufficient. If it fails, the postcondition allows for that.
   - The balance and allowance updates are checked correctly, including for zero-value transfers.

4. **`approve`**:
   - Postcondition checks that the `_spender` address is not zero.
   - The allowance is set to the specified `_value`, and the success condition checks for successful execution.

5. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Postcondition ensures that the returned `balance` matches the balance of the specified `_owner`.

6. **`allowance`**:
   - Postcondition ensures that the returned `remaining` matches the amount allowed for `_spender` to withdraw from `_owner`.

### Additional Notes:
- The conditions are designed to ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and maintains consistency across related functions. 
- The checks for zero-value transfers are included to ensure that they are treated as normal transfers, which is a requirement of the ERC20 standard.
- This implementation should resolve the errors flagged by the verifier, ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions while adhering to the specified verification guidelines.

=== USER [2025-03-13 16:49:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **`totalSupply`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned `supply` matches the total supply stored in `_totalSupply`.

2. **`transfer`**:
   - **Postcondition for `_to`**: Ensures that the `_to` address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: The success condition checks that if the transfer is successful, the sender's balance must be sufficient. If it fails, the postcondition allows for that.
   - **Balance Updates**: The balance updates are checked correctly, allowing for zero-value transfers without affecting balances.

3. **`transferFrom`**:
   - **Postcondition for `_from` and `_to`**: Ensures neither address is zero.
   - **Success Condition**: Checks that the `_from` address has enough balance and that the allowance is sufficient for the transfer to proceed. If it fails, it allows for that.
   - **Balance and Allowance Updates**: Similar to the `transfer` function, it checks that balances are updated correctly, including for zero-value transfers.

4. **`approve`**:
   - **Postcondition for `_spender`**: Ensures that the `_spender` address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: The allowance is set to the specified `_value`, and the success condition checks for successful execution.

5. **`balanceOf`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned `balance` matches the balance of the specified `_owner`.

6. **`allowance`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned `remaining` matches the amount allowed for `_spender` to withdraw from `_owner`.

### Additional Notes:
- The conditions are designed to ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and maintains consistency across related functions. 
- The checks for zero-value transfers are included to ensure that they are treated as normal transfers, which is a requirement of the ERC20 standard.
- This implementation should resolve the errors flagged by the verifier, ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions while adhering to the specified verification guidelines.

2. **`transfer`**:
   - The postcondition checks that the `_to` address is not zero.
   - The success condition ensures that if the transfer is successful, the sender's balance must be sufficient. If the transfer fails, it allows for that.
   - The balance updates are checked correctly, allowing for zero-value transfers without affecting balances.

3. **`transferFrom`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that both `_from` and `_to` addresses are not zero.
   - The success condition checks that the `_from` address has enough balance and that the allowance is sufficient for the transfer to proceed. If it fails, it allows for that.
   - The balance and allowance updates are checked correctly, including for zero-value transfers.

4. **`approve`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the `_spender` address is not zero.
   - The allowance is set to the specified `_value`, and the success condition checks for successful execution.

5. **`balanceOf`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned `balance` matches the balance of the specified `_owner`.

6. **`allowance`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned `remaining` matches the amount allowed for `_spender` to withdraw from `_owner`.

### Additional Notes:
- The conditions are designed to ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and maintains consistency across related functions. 
- The checks for zero-value transfers are included to ensure that they are treated as normal transfers, which is a requirement of the ERC20 standard.
- This implementation should resolve the errors flagged by the verifier, ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions while adhering to the specified verification guidelines.
