    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer, while also ensuring that the sender and recipient are not the same for the changes to apply.

These postconditions follow the ERC1155 standard, ensuring that the contract behaves as expected and provides the necessary safety checks for token transfers and approvals.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:32:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions
1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance for the specified owner and token ID matches the stored balance.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays match.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient for each token type in the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

These postconditions adhere to the ERC1155 standard and ensure proper behavior and safety checks for token transfers and approvals.

Based on the requirements and the feedback from the verification process, I will provide corrected postconditions for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the ERC1155 contract. The goal is to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes while adhering to the verification guidelines.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance for the specified owner and token ID matches the stored balance.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays match.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient for each token type in the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

### Adjustments Made
The postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` have been carefully checked and modified to ensure they reflect the necessary checks and state transitions accurately. The conditions ensure that all balances are checked before and after the transfer, addressing the errors noted during the verification process.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 14:34:23] ===
It appears that the postconditions for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function in the ERC1155 contract need to be adjusted to ensure that they accurately reflect the state changes and satisfy the verification requirements. Specifically, the error messages indicate that the conditions regarding the balances of the sender may not hold at the end of the function.

Here’s the annotated ERC1155 contract with the corrected postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance for the specified owner and token ID matches the stored balance.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays match.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient for each token type in the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

### Adjustments Made
The postconditions for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function have been carefully adjusted to ensure that they reflect the necessary checks and state transitions accurately. The conditions ensure that all balances are checked before and after the transfer, addressing the errors noted during the verification process.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:35:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 14:35:11] ===
To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with formal verification conditions, particularly addressing the feedback regarding the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, we need to ensure that postconditions accurately reflect the state changes while adhering to the ERC1155 standard and the verification guidelines.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance for the specified owner and token ID matches the stored balance.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays match.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient for each token type in the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

### Adjustments Made
The postconditions for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function have been modified to ensure that they accurately reflect the necessary checks and state transitions. The conditions ensure that all balances are correctly checked and updated before and after the transfer, addressing the errors noted during the verification process. The use of `forall` ensures that the conditions apply to each element in the arrays `_ids` and `_values`.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:35:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To address the issues regarding postconditions in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function of the ERC1155 contract, we need to ensure that the annotations are correctly formatted and logically sound. The errors indicate that the current postconditions are not being parsed correctly, likely due to incorrect syntax.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance for the specified owner and token ID matches the stored balance.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays match.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient for each token type in the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

### Adjustments Made
The postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` have been modified to ensure they accurately reflect the necessary checks and state transitions. The use of `forall` ensures that the conditions apply to each element in the arrays `_ids` and `_values`, which should resolve the parsing errors observed during verification. Each condition checks that the balances before and after the transfer are valid and consistent with the expected behavior of the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:36:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To resolve the issues regarding the postconditions in the ERC1155 contract, we need to ensure that the annotations are formatted correctly and logically sound. The errors you encountered suggest that the syntax used in the postconditions may not be correct for the solc-verify tool.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance for the specified owner and token ID matches the stored balance.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays match.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient for each token type in the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

### Adjustments Made
The postconditions have been adjusted to ensure they are in the correct syntax for the solc-verify tool. The conditions properly use `forall` to iterate over the indices of the `_ids` and `_values` arrays, ensuring that the conditions apply to each element in these arrays. This should resolve the parsing errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:36:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with formal verification conditions, we will ensure that the postconditions are correctly formatted and logically sound, addressing the errors encountered during the verification process. The goal is to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance for the specified owner and token ID matches the stored balance.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays match.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient for each token type in the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

### Key Adjustments Made
The postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` have been adjusted to ensure they use the correct syntax and logical structure. The use of `forall` is now correctly applied, ensuring that the conditions check each element in the arrays `_ids` and `_values`. This should address the parsing errors encountered during verification and ensure compliance with the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:37:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with formal verification conditions, we will ensure that the postconditions are correctly formatted and logically sound. The errors you encountered suggest that the syntax used in the postconditions may not be correct for the solc-verify tool.

        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance for the specified owner and token ID matches the stored balance.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays match.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient for each token type in the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

### Key Adjustments Made
The postconditions have been carefully formatted to ensure they are in the correct syntax for the solc-verify tool. The conditions use `forall` to iterate over the indices of the `_ids` and `_values` arrays, ensuring that the conditions apply to each element in these arrays. This should resolve the parsing errors and ensure compliance with the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:38:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 14:38:44] ===
To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with formal verification conditions, we need to ensure that the postconditions are correctly formatted and logically sound. The errors you encountered suggest that there are issues with the syntax used in the postconditions, particularly with how the `forall` constructs are expressed.

Here’s the annotated ERC1155 contract with the appropriate postconditions added:

```solidity

        MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.
        MUST revert on any other error.
        MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        @param _from    Source address
        @param _to      Target address

        @param _values  Transfer amounts per token type (order and length must match _ids array)
        @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to`

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance for the specified owner and token ID matches the stored balance.

2. **balanceOfBatch**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned batch balances matches the lengths of the provided owners and IDs.
   - Ensures that each returned balance for a specific owner and token ID corresponds to the stored balance.

3. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**:
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays match.
   - Ensures that the balance of the sender is sufficient for each token type in the transfer.
   - Ensures that the balances for each token ID are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

### Key Adjustments Made
The postconditions have been formatted to ensure they are in the correct syntax for the solc-verify tool. The conditions use `forall` to iterate over the indices of the `_ids` and `_values` arrays, ensuring that the conditions apply to each element in these arrays. This should resolve the parsing errors and ensure compliance with the ERC1155 standard.
