=== USER [2025-03-14 18:26:11] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Functions**: The balance functions ensure that the returned balance directly corresponds to the mapping of balances.
2. **Batch Balance Function**: The batch balance function checks that the length of the returned balances matches the length of the input owners and that each balance corresponds to the expected value in the mapping.
3. **Approval Function**: The approval function ensures that the approval status is updated correctly and prevents self-approval.
4. **Transfer Functions**: The transfer functions ensure that the balances are updated correctly, and the caller is either the token holder or an approved operator. The postconditions also ensure that the changes in balances are consistent with the specified values transferred.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:26:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Postconditions**: The postconditions have been structured to ensure they are valid expressions according to the solc-verify syntax.
2. **Forall Syntax**: The `forall` syntax has been corrected to ensure it is properly formatted, allowing for the correct interpretation by the verifier.
3. **Consistency**: Each postcondition is consistent with the expected behavior of the functions as defined in the ERC-1155 standard.

This should resolve the errors encountered during the compilation process while ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:27:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Functions**:
   - For `balanceOf`: The returned balance must match the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping.
   - For `balanceOfBatch`: The length of the returned `batchBalances` must equal the length of `_owners`, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.

2. **Approval Function**:
   - For `setApprovalForAll`: The approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping must reflect the new approval state, and self-approval is explicitly disallowed.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - For `safeTransferFrom`: The balances must be updated according to the transfer amount, and the caller must be either the token holder or an approved operator.
   - For `safeBatchTransferFrom`: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but it handles multiple token transfers. The postconditions ensure that each balance is updated correctly for each token ID.

These conditions are designed to ensure the integrity of the contract's state before and after function calls, adhering to the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:28:08] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Functions**:
   - **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance for a specific token ID and owner must match the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.
   - **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.

2. **Approval Function**:
   - **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping must reflect the new approval state. Additionally, self-approval is explicitly disallowed.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated according to the transferred value. The caller must be either the token holder or an approved operator.
   - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but handles multiple token transfers. The postconditions ensure that each balance is updated correctly for each token ID.

These postconditions are designed to ensure the integrity of the contract's state before and after function calls, adhering to the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:28:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Functions**:
   - **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance for a specific token ID and owner must match the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.
   - **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.

2. **Approval Function**:
   - **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping must reflect the new approval state. Additionally, self-approval is explicitly disallowed.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated according to the transferred value. The caller must be either the token holder or an approved operator.
   - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but handles multiple token transfers. The postconditions ensure that each balance is updated correctly for each token ID.

These postconditions ensure the integrity of the contract's state before and after function calls, adhering to the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:29:48] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points in the Postconditions:
1. **Balance Functions**:
   - **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the returned balance matches the mapping value.
   - **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures the returned array length is consistent and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

2. **Approval Function**:
   - **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status is updated correctly in the mapping, and self-approval is disallowed.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures that balances are updated correctly after a transfer, with checks for approval.
   - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but handles multiple transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's state is consistent and adheres to the expected behavior defined in the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:30:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

### Summary of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Functions**:
   - **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the returned balance matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping for the given token ID and owner.
   - **`balanceOfBatch`**: Validates the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to the specified owner and token ID.

2. **Approval Function**:
   - **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping and that self-approval is not allowed.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures balances are updated correctly after a transfer, validating that the caller is either the token holder or an approved operator.
   - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applies to multiple tokens, ensuring all balances are updated correctly for each token ID.

These postconditions help to maintain the integrity of the contract's state and ensure compliance with the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:31:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Functions**:
   - **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the value stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.
   - **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must be equal to the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.

2. **Approval Function**:
   - **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping must reflect the new approval state, and self-approval is explicitly disallowed.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated according to the transfer amount. The caller must be either the token holder or an approved operator.
   - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but handles multiple token transfers. The postconditions ensure that each balance is updated correctly for each token ID.

These conditions ensure the integrity of the contract's state before and after function calls, adhering to the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:32:25] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Postconditions Explained:
1. **Balance Functions**:
   - **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance for a specific token ID and owner must match the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.
   - **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.

2. **Approval Function**:
   - **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping must reflect the new approval state, and self-approval is explicitly disallowed.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated according to the transferred value, and the caller must be either the token holder or an approved operator.
   - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but handles multiple token transfers, ensuring that each balance is updated correctly for each token ID.

These postconditions ensure the integrity of the contract's state and compliance with the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:33:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Summary of Postconditions:
1. **Balance Functions**:
   - **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the returned balance matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.
   - **`balanceOfBatch`**: Validates the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to the specified owner and token ID.

2. **Approval Function**:
   - **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval status is correctly updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping and that self-approval is disallowed.

3. **Transfer Functions**:
   - **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures that balances are updated correctly after a transfer, validating that the caller is either the token holder or an approved operator.
   - **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applies to multiple tokens, ensuring all balances are updated correctly for each token ID.

These postconditions help to maintain the integrity of the contract's state and ensure compliance with the ERC-1155 standard.
