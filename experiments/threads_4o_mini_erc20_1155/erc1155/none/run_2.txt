=== USER [2025-03-14 18:34:20] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the stored balance in `_balances` for the given owner and token ID.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned balances array must match the length of the owners array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of the sender and receiver must be updated correctly according to the transfer, and the transfer event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The balances of all sender and receiver accounts must be updated correctly for each token ID, and the batch transfer event must be emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

### Explanation of Adjustments:
- **Postcondition Syntax**: The emit statements for events are prefixed with `emit` to comply with the expected syntax.
- **Forall Syntax**: The `forall` syntax is corrected to ensure it is properly recognized by the solc-verify tool.
- **Consistency**: The postconditions are consistent with the expected behavior defined by the ERC1155 standard, ensuring that state changes are properly reflected in the balances and approvals.

These annotations should now correctly represent the expected behavior of the contract and adhere to the verification guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:35:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance in `_balances` for the given token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned balances array must match the length of the owners array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of the sender and receiver must be updated correctly according to the transfer, and the transfer event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The balances of all sender and receiver accounts must be updated correctly for each token ID, and the batch transfer event must be emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:36:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the stored balance in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned balances array must match the length of the owners array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of the sender and receiver must be updated correctly based on the transfer, and the transfer event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The balances of all sender and receiver accounts must be updated correctly for each token ID, and the batch transfer event must be emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:36:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of the sender and receiver must be updated correctly according to the transfer, and the transfer event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The balances of all sender and receiver accounts must be updated correctly for each token ID, and the batch transfer event must be emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:37:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of the sender and receiver must be updated correctly according to the transfer, and the transfer event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The balances of all sender and receiver accounts must be updated correctly for each token ID, and the batch transfer event must be emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:38:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of the sender and receiver must be updated correctly according to the transfer, and the transfer event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The balances of all sender and receiver accounts must be updated correctly for each token ID, and the batch transfer event must be emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:39:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of the sender and receiver must be updated correctly according to the transfer, and the transfer event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The balances of all sender and receiver accounts must be updated correctly for each token ID, and the batch transfer event must be emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and provides a basis for formal verification. If you encounter any errors while compiling or running the verification, please provide the specific error messages for further assistance.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:39:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of the sender and receiver must be updated correctly according to the transfer, and the transfer event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The balances of all sender and receiver accounts must be updated correctly for each token ID, and the batch transfer event must be emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and provides a basis for formal verification. If you encounter any compilation or verification errors, please provide the specific error messages for further assistance.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:41:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be accurately reflected in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping after the function call.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of the sender and receiver must be updated correctly according to the transfer, and the transfer event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The balances of all sender and receiver accounts must be updated correctly for each token ID, and the batch transfer event must be emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and provides a basis for formal verification. If you encounter any compilation or verification errors, please provide the specific error messages for further assistance.
