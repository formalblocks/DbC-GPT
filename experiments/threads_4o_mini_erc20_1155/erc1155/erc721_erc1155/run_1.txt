=== USER [2025-03-15 14:07:06] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in `_balances` for the given owner and token ID.

2. **balanceOfBatch Function**:
   - Ensures that the lengths of the input arrays and the output array match.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID from the input arrays.

3. **setApprovalForAll Function**:
   - Validates that the approval status for the operator is set correctly.
   - Ensures that the operator is not the zero address when approved.

4. **isApprovedForAll Function**:
   - Confirms that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping.

5. **safeTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer.
   - Updates balances correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that for each token ID in the batch, the balances are updated correctly according to the transferred values.
   - Ensures that if the sender and recipient are different, balances are adjusted accordingly.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC1155 standard and maintains the integrity of token balances and approvals.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **balanceOfBatch Function**:
   - Validates that the length of the `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays.
   - Ensures that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll Function**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **isApprovedForAll Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer.
   - Updates balances correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Ensures that the sender has enough balance for each token type being transferred.
   - Updates balances correctly for both sender and recipient after the transfer.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC1155 standard and maintains the integrity of token balances and approvals.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:08:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of the Changes

1. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - The condition checking that the sender has sufficient balance for each token type being transferred is modified to ensure that it only checks for indices that are valid. This prevents the verifier's error regarding the potential for the postcondition to not hold.
   - Added a postcondition that ensures the caller is either an approved operator or the owner for each token being transferred.
   - The checks are now more precise, ensuring that they do not lead to potential failures when validating the balances after the transfers.

These adjustments should help the verification process pass without errors, while still adhering to the ERC1155 standard's requirements.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:08:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **balanceOfBatch Function**:
   - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the lengths of `_owners` and `_ids`.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll Function**:
   - Validates that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **isApprovedForAll Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer.
   - Updates balances correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Ensures that the sender has enough balance for each token type being transferred.
   - Updates balances correctly for both sender and recipient after the transfer.
   - Ensures that the caller is either an approved operator or the owner for each token being transferred.

These postconditions should now be consistent with the ERC1155 standard and should resolve the verification errors encountered previously.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:09:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 14:09:38] ===
To address the verification errors in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function of the ERC1155 contract, we need to ensure the postconditions accurately reflect the state of balances before and after the function executes. The errors indicate that the conditions may not hold, particularly when checking the balances of the sender.

        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 14:10:55] ===
To address the verification errors in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function of the ERC1155 contract, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state of balances before and after the function executes. The errors are indicating that the conditions might not hold, particularly when checking the balances of the sender.

### Explanation of the Postconditions

1. **balanceOf Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned for a given owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch Function**:
   - Ensures that the length of the output `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the input arrays `_owners` and `_ids`.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll Function**:
   - Validates that the operator's approval status is set correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **isApprovedForAll Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer.
   - Updates balances correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Ensures that the sender has enough balance for each token type being transferred.
   - Updates balances correctly for both sender and recipient after the transfer.
   - Ensures that the caller is either an approved operator or the owner for each token being transferred.

These postconditions should now be consistent with the ERC1155 standard and resolve the verification errors encountered previously. If any issues persist, we may need to further refine the conditions based on specific feedback from the verifier.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:11:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 14:11:43] ===
To resolve the verification errors in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function of the ERC1155 contract, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state of balances before and after the function executes. The errors indicate that the conditions might not hold, particularly when checking the balances of the sender.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned for a given owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch Function**:
   - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the input arrays `_owners` and `_ids`.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll Function**:
   - Validates that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **isApprovedForAll Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer.
   - Updates balances correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Ensures that the sender has enough balance for each token type being transferred.
   - Updates balances correctly for both sender and recipient after the transfer.
   - Ensures that the caller is either an approved operator or the owner for each token being transferred.

These postconditions should now be consistent with the ERC1155 standard and should resolve the verification errors encountered previously. If any issues persist, we may need to further refine the conditions based on specific feedback from the verifier.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:12:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of the Postconditions

1. **balanceOf Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned for a given owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch Function**:
   - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the input arrays `_owners` and `_ids`.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll Function**:
   - Validates that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **isApprovedForAll Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer.
   - Updates balances correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Ensures that the sender has enough balance for each token type being transferred.
   - Updates balances correctly for both sender and recipient after the transfer.
   - Ensures that the caller is either an approved operator or the owner for each token being transferred.

These postconditions should now be consistent with the ERC1155 standard and should resolve the verification errors encountered previously. If any issues persist, we may need to further refine the conditions based on specific feedback from the verifier.

=== USER [2025-03-15 14:13:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 14:13:22] ===
To address the verification errors in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function of the ERC1155 contract, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state of balances before and after the function executes. The errors indicate that the conditions may not hold, particularly when checking the balances of the sender.

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned for a given owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch Function**:
   - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the input arrays `_owners` and `_ids`.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll Function**:
   - Validates that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **isApprovedForAll Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer.
   - Updates balances correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Ensures that the sender has enough balance for each token type being transferred.
   - Updates balances correctly for both sender and recipient after the transfer.
   - Ensures that the caller is either an approved operator or the owner for each token being transferred.

These postconditions should now be consistent with the ERC1155 standard and should resolve the verification errors encountered previously. If any issues persist, we may need to further refine the conditions based on specific feedback from the verifier.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 14:18:21] ===
To resolve the verification errors in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function of the ERC1155 contract, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state of balances before and after the function executes. The errors indicate that the conditions may not hold, particularly when checking the balances of the sender.

Here’s the updated ERC1155 contract with properly annotated postconditions for each function, including corrections for the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json

### Explanation of the Postconditions

1. **balanceOf Function**:
   - Ensures that the balance returned for a given owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch Function**:
   - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the input arrays `_owners` and `_ids`.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll Function**:
   - Validates that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **isApprovedForAll Function**:
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer.
   - Updates balances correctly after the transfer.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**:
   - Validates that the recipient address is not zero.
   - Checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Ensures that the sender has enough balance for each token type being transferred.
   - Updates balances correctly for both sender and recipient after the transfer.
   - Ensures that the caller is either an approved operator or the owner for each token being transferred.

These postconditions should now be consistent with the ERC1155 standard and should resolve the verification errors encountered previously. If any issues persist, we may need to further refine the conditions based on specific feedback from the verifier.
