=== USER [2025-03-14 23:02:34] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
- **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the stored balance for the given token ID and owner.
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array must match the length of the owners array, and each balance must correspond to the respective owner and token ID.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status must reflect the intended change after the function call, and it must be consistent if the call fails.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the operator and owner.
- **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and the recipient must be updated correctly according to the transfer, and conditions for self-transfer are handled. It also checks for the success of the operation.
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but it handles an array of IDs and values. It ensures that the lengths of the arrays match and that balances are updated correctly for each token type.

Each postcondition is designed to ensure that the function's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and maintains the integrity of the token balances and approvals.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:03:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the stored balance for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The returned array of balances must have the same length as the owners array, with each balance corresponding to the respective owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status must reflect the intended change after the function call, and it must remain unchanged if the call fails.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the operator and owner.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated correctly according to the transfer, with special handling for self-transfers.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but it handles arrays of IDs and values. It ensures that the lengths of the arrays match and that balances are updated correctly for each token type.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and maintains the integrity of the token balances and approvals.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:03:49] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the stored balance for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The returned array of balances must have the same length as the owners array, with each balance corresponding to the respective owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status must reflect the intended change after the function call, and it must remain unchanged if the call fails.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the operator and owner.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated correctly according to the transfer, with special handling for self-transfers.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but it handles arrays of IDs and values. It ensures that the lengths of the arrays match and that balances are updated correctly for each token type.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and maintains the integrity of the token balances and approvals.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:04:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the stored balance for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The returned array of balances must have the same length as the owners array, with each balance corresponding to the respective owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status must reflect the intended change after the function call, and it must remain unchanged if the call fails.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the operator and owner.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated correctly according to the transfer, with special handling for self-transfers.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but it handles arrays of IDs and values. It ensures that the lengths of the arrays match and that balances are updated correctly for each token type.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC1155 standard and maintains the integrity of the token balances and approvals.

### Note on Errors:
The errors you encountered during compilation are related to the annotations. The conditions in the annotations must be syntactically correct and must refer to the correct state variables and types, as specified in the verification guidelines. If you encounter specific errors, please let me know, and I can help refine the annotations further.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:04:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the stored balance for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The returned array of balances must have the same length as the owners array, with each balance corresponding to the respective owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status must reflect the intended change after the function call, and it must remain unchanged if the call fails.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the operator and owner.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated correctly according to the transfer, with special handling for self-transfers.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but it handles arrays of IDs and values. It ensures that the lengths of the arrays match and that balances are updated correctly for each token type.

### Note on Errors:
The errors you encountered during compilation are likely due to syntax issues in the annotations. Ensure that the conditions in the annotations are syntactically correct and refer to the correct state variables and types, as specified in the verification guidelines. If you encounter specific errors, please provide them, and I can help refine the annotations further.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:05:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array of balances must match the length of the owners array, and each balance must correspond to the respective owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated to match the `_approved` parameter if the transaction is successful. If the transaction fails, the approval status must remain unchanged.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the operator and owner.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated correctly according to the transfer, with special handling for self-transfers.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but it handles arrays of IDs and values. It ensures that the lengths of the arrays match and that balances are updated correctly for each token type.

### Notes on Errors:
The errors you encountered during compilation are likely due to syntax issues in the annotations or references to state variables. Ensure that the conditions in the annotations are syntactically correct and refer to the correct state variables and types, as specified in the verification guidelines. If you encounter specific errors, please provide them, and I can help refine the annotations further.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array of balances must match the length of the owners array, and each balance must correspond to the respective owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated to match the `_approved` parameter if the transaction is successful. If the transaction fails, the approval status must remain unchanged.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the operator and owner.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances of both the sender and recipient must be updated correctly according to the transfer, with special handling for self-transfers.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but it handles arrays of IDs and values. It ensures that the lengths of the arrays match and that balances are updated correctly for each token type.

### Notes on Errors:
The errors you encountered during compilation are likely due to syntax issues in the annotations or references to state variables. Make sure that the conditions in the annotations are correctly formatted and refer to the appropriate state variables and types. If you encounter specific errors, please provide them, and I can help troubleshoot and refine the annotations further.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:07:43] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array `batchBalances` must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the respective owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated to match the `_approved` parameter if the transaction is successful. If the transaction fails, the approval status must remain unchanged.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the operator and owner.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balance of the sender must decrease by `_value` if the transfer is successful, and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`.
   - If `_from` is the same as `_to`, the balances should remain unchanged.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - The length of `_ids` must match the length of `_values`.
   - For each index `i`, the balance of the sender for `_ids[i]` must decrease by `_values[i]` if the transfer is successful, and the recipient's balance for `_ids[i]` must increase by `_values[i]`.
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, if `_from` is the same as `_to`, the balances should remain unchanged.

### Notes on Errors:
If you encounter specific errors during compilation, please provide them, and I can assist in troubleshooting and refining the annotations further. The errors you mentioned previously may relate to syntax issues or undeclared identifiers; ensure that the postconditions are correctly formatted and refer to the appropriate state variables.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:08:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must be equal to the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`, and each `batchBalances[i]` must equal `_balances[_owners[i]][_ids[i]]`.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated to match the `_approved` parameter if the transaction is successful. If it fails, the approval status must remain unchanged.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must equal the stored approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balance of `_from` for `_id` must decrease by `_value` if the transfer is successful, and the balance of `_to` for `_id` must increase by `_value`.
   - If `_from` is the same as `_to`, the balances should remain unchanged.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` must match.
   - For each index `i`, the balance of `_from` for `_ids[i]` must decrease by `_values[i]` if the transfer is successful, and the balance of `_to` for `_ids[i]` must increase by `_values[i]`.
   - If `_from` is the same as `_to`, the balances should remain unchanged.

### Notes on Errors:
If you encounter specific errors during compilation, please provide the detailed error messages, and I can assist you in troubleshooting and refining the annotations further. The issues may relate to syntax in the annotations or references to state variables, so ensuring the correctness of the postconditions is crucial.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:09:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array `batchBalances` must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each `batchBalances[i]` must equal `_balances[_owners[i]][_ids[i]]`.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated to match the `_approved` parameter if the transaction is successful. If it fails, the approval status must remain unchanged.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the operator and owner.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balance of `_from` for `_id` must decrease by `_value` if the transfer is successful, and the balance of `_to` for `_id` must increase by `_value`.
   - If `_from` is the same as `_to`, the balances should remain unchanged.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` must match.
   - For each index `i`, the balance of `_from` for `_ids[i]` must decrease by `_values[i]` if the transfer is successful, and the balance of `_to` for `_ids[i]` must increase by `_values[i]`.
   - If `_from` is the same as `_to`, the balances should remain unchanged.

### Notes on Errors:
If you encounter specific errors during compilation, please provide the detailed error messages, and I can assist you in troubleshooting and refining the annotations further. The issues may relate to syntax in the annotations or references to state variables, so ensuring the correctness of the postconditions is crucial.
