=== USER [2025-03-15 01:20:11] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The returned balance must match the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: The length of the returned balances must match the length of the owners, and each balance must correspond to the respective owner's balance in `_balances`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status must be correctly updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status must reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - The balance of the sender must decrease by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance must increase accordingly, unless it is a self-transfer.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applies to multiple tokens, ensuring that all balances are updated correctly and that the order is preserved.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behaviors defined in the ERC1155 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The returned balance must match the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: The length of the returned balances must match the length of the owners, and each balance must correspond to the respective owner's balance in `_balances`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status must be correctly updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status must reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is not a self-transfer, the sender's balance must decrease by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance must increase accordingly.
   - If it is a self-transfer, the balance must remain unchanged.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applies to multiple tokens, ensuring that all balances are updated correctly and that the order is preserved.

This format should resolve the parsing errors and ensure compliance with the ERC1155 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

        @param _to      Target address

        @param _values  Transfer amounts per token type (order and length must match _ids array)
        @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to`

    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to => for all i in [0, _ids.length): _balances[_ids[i]][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i])
    /// @notice postcondition (_from != _to => for all i in [0, _ids.length): _balances[_ids[i]][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i])

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The returned balance must match the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each `batchBalances[i]` must equal `_balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status must be correctly updated in `_operatorApprovals` to reflect the value of `_approved`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status must reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is not a self-transfer (`_from != _to`), the sender's balance must decrease by `_value` and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`.
   - If it is a self-transfer (`_from == _to`), the sender's balance remains unchanged.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - For each token in `_ids`, if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the sender's balance must decrease by the respective amount in `_values`, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - If it is a self-transfer, the sender's balance for each token remains unchanged.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behaviors defined in the ERC1155 standard and resolve the parsing errors you encountered.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:21:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each `batchBalances[i]` must equal `_balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status must be correctly updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status must reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is not a self-transfer (`_from != _to`), the sender's balance must decrease by `_value` and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`.
   - If it is a self-transfer (`_from == _to`), the balance remains unchanged.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - For each token in `_ids`, if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the sender's balance must decrease by the respective amount in `_values`, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - If it is a self-transfer, the sender's balance for each token remains unchanged.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behaviors defined in the ERC1155 standard and should resolve the parsing errors you encountered.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:22:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_id` and `_owner`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the respective owner and token ID in `_balances`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status must be updated in `_operatorApprovals` to reflect the value of `_approved`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status must accurately reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is not a self-transfer (`_from != _to`), the sender's balance must decrease by `_value`, and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`.
   - If it is a self-transfer (`_from == _to`), the balance remains unchanged.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - For each token in `_ids`, if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the sender's balance must decrease by the respective amount in `_values`, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - If it is a self-transfer, the sender's balance for each token remains unchanged.

This structure should resolve the parsing errors you are experiencing while ensuring that the contract adheres to the expected behaviors defined in the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:23:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the respective owner and token ID in `_balances`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status must be updated in `_operatorApprovals` to reflect the value of `_approved`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status must accurately reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is not a self-transfer (`_from != _to`), the sender's balance must decrease by `_value`, and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`.
   - If it is a self-transfer (`_from == _to`), the balance remains unchanged.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - For each token in `_ids`, if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the sender's balance must decrease by the respective amount in `_values`, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - If it is a self-transfer, the sender's balance for each token remains unchanged.

These annotations ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behaviors defined in the ERC1155 standard and should help resolve any parsing errors in the verification process.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:23:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the respective owner and token ID in `_balances`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status must be updated in `_operatorApprovals` to reflect the value of `_approved`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The returned approval status must accurately reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is not a self-transfer (`_from != _to`), the sender's balance must decrease by `_value`, and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`.
   - If it is a self-transfer (`_from == _to`), the balance remains unchanged.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - For each token in `_ids`, if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the sender's balance must decrease by the respective amount in `_values`, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - If it is a self-transfer, the sender's balance for each token remains unchanged.

This structure should meet the requirements and resolve the parsing errors you have encountered.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Here’s the ERC1155 smart contract interface annotated with appropriate postconditions for each function, using the solc-verify syntax. This will help ensure that the expected behaviors of the functions are clearly defined and consistent with the ERC standard.

```solidity

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The returned balance must match the value stored in `_balances` for the given token ID and owner.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must equal the length of `_owners`.
   - Each `batchBalances[i]` must equal `_balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status must be updated in `_operatorApprovals` to reflect the value of `_approved`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status must accurately reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is not a self-transfer (`_from != _to`), the sender's balance must decrease by `_value`, and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`.
   - If it is a self-transfer (`_from == _to`), the balance remains unchanged.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - For each token in `_ids`, if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the sender's balance must decrease by the respective amount in `_values`, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - If it is a self-transfer, the sender's balance for each token remains unchanged.

This structure should meet the requirements for formal verification and resolve any parsing errors in the verification process.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:25:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each `batchBalances[i]` must equal `_balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - The approval status must be updated in `_operatorApprovals` to reflect the value of `_approved`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - The returned approval status must accurately reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is not a self-transfer (`_from != _to`), the sender's balance must decrease by `_value`, and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`.
   - If it is a self-transfer (`_from == _to`), the balance remains unchanged.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - For each token in `_ids`, if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the sender's balance must decrease by the respective amount in `_values`, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - If it is a self-transfer, the sender's balance for each token remains unchanged.

These annotations ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behaviors defined in the ERC1155 standard and should help resolve any parsing errors in the verification process.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:26:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must match the value stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must equal the length of `_owners`.
   - Each `batchBalances[i]` must equal `_balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]`.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status in `_operatorApprovals` must be updated to reflect the value of `_approved`.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status must accurately reflect the value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is not a self-transfer (`_from != _to`), the sender's balance must decrease by `_value`, and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`.
   - If it is a self-transfer (`_from == _to`), the balance remains unchanged.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - For each token in `_ids`, if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the sender's balance must decrease by the respective amount in `_values`, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - If it is a self-transfer, the sender's balance for each token remains unchanged.

These annotations should help ensure compliance with the ERC1155 standard and resolve any parsing errors during verification.
