=== USER [2025-03-15 00:42:31] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Validates that the length of the returned array matches the owners array and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned approval status is as expected.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that balances are adjusted correctly for both the sender and receiver, taking into account the conditions for self-transfers.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, checks that balances are adjusted correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Confirms that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Checks that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored approval state.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Ensures that balances are updated correctly for both sender and receiver, with special handling for self-transfers.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, it checks that balances are updated correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

### Key Corrections:
- Used the correct syntax for `forall` to ensure compatibility with solc-verify.
- Ensured that postconditions are logically sound and reflect the expected behavior of the contract according to the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:44:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Validates that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned approval status is as expected.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that balances are adjusted correctly for both the sender and receiver, with special handling for self-transfers.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, checks that balances are updated correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

### Key Corrections:
- Correctly formatted the `forall` constructs to ensure compatibility with solc-verify.
- Ensured that postconditions logically represent the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard. 

These annotations should help in formal verification of the smart contract functions.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:45:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Validates that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned approval status is as expected.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that balances are adjusted correctly for both the sender and receiver, with special handling for self-transfers.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, checks that balances are updated correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

### Key Corrections:
- Correctly formatted the `forall` constructs to ensure compatibility with solc-verify.
- Ensured that postconditions logically represent the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.

These annotations should assist in formal verification of the smart contract functions.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:45:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Validates that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned approval status is as expected.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that balances are adjusted correctly for both the sender and receiver, with special handling for self-transfers (when `_from` equals `_to`).
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, checks that balances are updated correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

### Key Corrections:
- The `forall` constructs were formatted correctly for solc-verify compatibility.
- Each postcondition logically represents the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.

These annotations will assist in formal verification of the smart contract functions. If you encounter any specific errors or issues during compilation or verification, please provide the details so that I can assist you further.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:46:52] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Confirms that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Validates that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored approval state.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that balances are updated correctly for both the sender and receiver, with special handling for self-transfers (when `_from` equals `_to`).
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, checks that balances are updated correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

### Key Corrections:
- Correctly formatted the `forall` constructs to ensure compatibility with solc-verify.
- Ensured that postconditions logically represent the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.

These annotations will assist in the formal verification of the smart contract functions. If you encounter any specific errors or issues during compilation or verification, please provide the details so that I can assist you further.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:47:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Validates that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned approval status is as expected.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that balances are updated correctly for both the sender and receiver, with special handling for self-transfers (when `_from` equals `_to`).
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, checks that balances are updated correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

### Key Corrections:
- The `forall` constructs were formatted correctly for solc-verify compatibility.
- Each postcondition logically represents the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.

These annotations will assist in the formal verification of the smart contract functions. If you encounter any specific errors or issues during compilation or verification, please provide the details so that I can assist you further.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:48:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Validates that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned approval status matches the stored approval state.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that balances are adjusted correctly for both the sender and receiver, with special handling for self-transfers (when `_from` equals `_to`).
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, checks that balances are updated correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

### Key Corrections:
- Correctly formatted the `forall` constructs for solc-verify compatibility.
- Each postcondition logically represents the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.

These annotations will assist in the formal verification of the smart contract functions. If you encounter any specific errors or issues during compilation or verification, please provide the details so that I can assist you further.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:48:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Validates that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned approval status is as expected.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that balances are updated correctly for both the sender and receiver, with special handling for self-transfers (when `_from` equals `_to`).
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, checks that balances are updated correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

### Key Corrections:
- The `forall` constructs were formatted correctly for solc-verify compatibility.
- Each postcondition logically represents the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.

These annotations will assist in the formal verification of the smart contract functions. If you encounter any specific errors or issues during compilation or verification, please provide the details so that I can assist you further.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:49:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Validates that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct mapping.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set as intended.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures the returned approval status is as expected.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that balances are updated correctly for both the sender and receiver, with special handling for self-transfers (when `_from` equals `_to`).
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to the single transfer, checks that balances are updated correctly for all tokens transferred, ensuring consistency in batch operations.

### Key Corrections:
- The `forall` constructs were formatted correctly for solc-verify compatibility.
- Each postcondition logically represents the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.

These annotations will assist in the formal verification of the smart contract functions. If you encounter any specific errors or issues during compilation or verification, please provide the details so that I can assist you further.
