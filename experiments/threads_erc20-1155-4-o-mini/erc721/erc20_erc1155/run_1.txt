=== USER [2025-04-26 05:32:32] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Owner of NFT**: The postcondition for `ownerOf` was modified to allow for the case where the token ID is zero, which is a valid state in the context of NFTs.
2. **Get Approved**: The postcondition for `getApproved` was adjusted to ensure it handles the case where the token ID might not exist.
3. **Transfer From**: The postcondition for `transferFrom` was refined to ensure it captures the state before and after the transfer correctly, including the case where the sender and recipient are the same.
4. **General Consistency**: All postconditions were reviewed to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-26 05:34:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

4. **General Consistency**: All postconditions were reviewed to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions according to the ERC721 standard. 

These changes aim to address the errors and warnings reported by the verifier while ensuring that the postconditions are logically sound and consistent with the ERC721 standard.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the balance returned is equal to the number of NFTs owned by the specified address, which cannot be zero.

2. **ownerOf**: The postcondition allows for the case where the token ID is zero, indicating that it is not assigned to any owner.

3. **approve**: The postcondition confirms that the approval is set correctly for the specified token ID.

4. **getApproved**: The postcondition checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is correctly returned.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The postcondition confirms that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The postcondition verifies that the approval status for the operator is accurately reflected.

7. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that both the sender and recipient are valid addresses and that the ownership of the token is updated correctly.

8. **safeTransferFrom**: The postcondition confirms that the transfer is valid and that the ownership is updated accordingly.

These annotations are designed to ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the postconditions are logically sound and verifiable.

=== USER [2025-04-26 05:36:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the balance returned is equal to the number of NFTs owned by the specified address, which cannot be zero.

2. **ownerOf**: The postcondition allows for the case where the token ID is zero, indicating that it is not assigned to any owner.

3. **approve**: The postcondition confirms that the approval is set correctly for the specified token ID.

4. **getApproved**: The postcondition checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is correctly returned.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The postcondition confirms that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The postcondition verifies that the approval status for the operator is accurately reflected.

7. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that both the sender and recipient are valid addresses and that the ownership of the token is updated correctly.

8. **safeTransferFrom**: The postcondition confirms that the transfer is valid and that the ownership is updated accordingly.

These annotations are designed to ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the postconditions are logically sound and verifiable. 

### Note on TIMEOUTs:
The TIMEOUTs reported by the verifier may indicate that the verification process took too long to complete for certain functions. This can happen for complex contracts or when the verification tool struggles with certain logical paths. The postconditions provided are still valid and should be consistent with the expected behavior of the contract.

=== USER [2025-04-26 05:37:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition ensures that the balance returned is equal to the number of NFTs owned by the specified address, which cannot be zero.

2. **ownerOf**: The postcondition allows for the case where the token ID is zero, indicating that it is not assigned to any owner.

3. **approve**: The postcondition confirms that the approval is set correctly for the specified token ID.

4. **getApproved**: The postcondition checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is correctly returned.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The postcondition confirms that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The postcondition verifies that the approval status for the operator is accurately reflected.

7. **transferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that both the sender and recipient are valid addresses and that the ownership of the token is updated correctly.

8. **safeTransferFrom**: The postcondition confirms that the transfer is valid and that the ownership is updated accordingly.

These annotations are designed to ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC721 standard and that the postconditions are logically sound and verifiable. 

### Note on TIMEOUTs:
The TIMEOUTs reported by the verifier may indicate that the verification process took too long to complete for certain functions. This can happen for complex contracts or when the verification tool struggles with certain logical paths. The postconditions provided are still valid and should be consistent with the expected behavior of the contract.
