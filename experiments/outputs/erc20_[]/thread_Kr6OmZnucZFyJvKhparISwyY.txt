This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.\n\n                We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers ("operators"). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more:\n\n                - Physical property — houses, unique artwork\n                - Virtual collectibles — unique pictures of kittens, collectible cards\n                - "Negative value" assets — loans, burdens and other responsibilities\n\n                In general, all houses are distinct and no two kittens are alike. NFTs are *distinguishable* and you must track the ownership of each one separately.\n\n                ## Motivation\n\n                A standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any NFT on Ethereum. We provide for simple ERC-721 smart contracts as well as contracts that track an *arbitrarily large* number of NFTs. Additional applications are discussed below.\n\n                This standard is inspired by the ERC-20 token standard and builds on two years of experience since EIP-20 was created. EIP-20 is insufficient for tracking NFTs because each asset is distinct (non-fungible) whereas each of a quantity of tokens is identical (fungible).\n\n                Differences between this standard and EIP-20 are examined below.\n\n                ## Specification\n\n                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\n                **Every ERC-721 compliant contract must implement the `ERC721` and `ERC165` interfaces** (subject to "caveats" below):\n\n                ```solidity\n                pragma solidity ^0.4.20;\n\n                /// @title ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard\n                /// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721\n                ///  Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x80ac58cd.\n                interface ERC721 /* is ERC165 */ {\n                    /// @dev This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism.\n                    ///  This event emits when NFTs are created (`from` == 0) and destroyed\n                    ///  (`to` == 0).

This allows your contract to publish its full list of NFTs and make them discoverable.\n\n                ```solidity\n                /// @title ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard, optional enumeration extension\n                /// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721\n                ///  Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x780e9d63.\n                interface ERC721Enumerable /* is ERC721 */ {\n                    /// @notice Count NFTs tracked by this contract\n                    /// @return A count of valid NFTs tracked by this contract, where each one of\n                    ///  them has an assigned and queryable owner not equal to the zero address\n                    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);\n\n                    /// @notice Enumerate valid NFTs\n                    /// @dev Throws if `_index` >= `totalSupply()`.\n                    /// @param _index A counter less than `totalSupply()`\n                    /// @return The token identifier for the `_index`th NFT,\n                    ///  (sort order not specified)\n                    function tokenByIndex(uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256);\n\n                    /// @notice Enumerate NFTs assigned to an owner\n                    /// @dev Throws if `_index` >= `balanceOf(_owner)` or if\n                    ///  `_owner` is the zero address, representing invalid NFTs.\n                    /// @param _owner An address where we are interested in NFTs owned by them\n                    /// @param _index A counter less than `balanceOf(_owner)`\n                    /// @return The token identifier for the `_index`th NFT assigned to `_owner`,\n                    ///   (sort order not specified)\n                    function tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address _owner, uint256 _index) external view returns (uint256);\n                }\n                ```\n\n                ### Caveats\n\n                The 0.4.20 Solidity interface grammar is not expressive enough to document the ERC-721 standard. A contract which complies with ERC-721 MUST also abide by the following:\n\n                - Solidity issue #3412: The above interfaces include explicit mutability guarantees for each function. Mutability guarantees are, in order weak to strong: `payable`, implicit nonpayable, `view`, and `pure`. Your implementation MUST meet the mutability guarantee in this interface and you MAY meet a stronger guarantee. For example, a `payable` function in this interface may be implemented as nonpayable (no state mutability specified) in your contract. We expect a later Solidity release will allow your stricter contract to inherit from this interface, but a workaround for version 0.4.20 is that you can edit this interface to add stricter mutability before inheriting from your contract.\n                - Solidity issue #3419: A contract that implements `ERC721Metadata` or `ERC721Enumerable` SHALL also implement `ERC721`. ERC-721 implements the requirements of interface ERC-165.\n                - Solidity issue #2330: If a function is shown in this specification as `external` then a contract will be compliant if it uses `public` visibility. As a workaround for version 0.4.20, you can edit this interface to switch to `public` before inheriting from your contract.\n                - Solidity issues #3494, #3544: Use of `this.*.selector` is marked as a warning by Solidity, a future version of Solidity will not mark this as an error.\n\n                *If a newer version of Solidity allows the caveats to be expressed in code, then this EIP MAY be updated and the caveats removed, such will be equivalent to the original specification.*\n\n                ## Rationale\n\n                There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that depend on tracking distinguishable assets. Examples of existing or planned NFTs are LAND in Decentraland, the eponymous punks in CryptoPunks, and in-game items using systems like DMarket or EnjinCoin. Future uses include tracking real-world assets, like real-estate (as envisioned by companies like Ubitquity or Propy). It is critical in each of these cases that these items are not "lumped together" as numbers in a ledger, but instead each asset must have its ownership individually and atomically tracked. Regardless of the nature of these assets, the ecosystem will be stronger if we have a standardized interface that allows for cross-functional asset management and sales platforms.\n\n                **"NFT" Word Choice**\n\n                "NFT" was satisfactory to nearly everyone surveyed and is widely applicable to a broad universe of distinguishable digital assets. We recognize that "deed" is very descriptive for certain applications of this standard (notably, physical property).\n\n                *Alternatives considered: distinguishable asset, title, token, asset, equity, ticket*\n\n                **NFT Identifiers**\n\n                Every NFT is identified by a unique `uint256` ID inside the ERC-721 smart contract. This identifying number SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The pair `(contract address, uint256 tokenId)` will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on an Ethereum chain. While some ERC-721 smart contracts may find it convenient to start with ID 0 and simply increment by one for each new NFT, callers SHALL NOT assume that ID numbers have any specific pattern to them, and MUST treat the ID as a "black box". Also note that NFTs MAY become invalid (be destroyed). Please see the enumeration functions for a supported enumeration interface.\n\n                The choice of `uint256` allows a wide variety of applications because UUIDs and sha3 hashes are directly convertible to `uint256`.\n\n                **Transfer Mechanism**\n\n                ERC-721 standardizes a safe transfer function `safeTransferFrom` (overloaded with and without a `bytes` parameter) and an unsafe function `transferFrom`. Transfers may be initiated by:\n\n                - The owner of an NFT\n                - The approved address of an NFT\n                - An authorized operator of the current owner of an NFT\n\n                Additionally, an authorized operator may set the approved address for an NFT. This provides a powerful set of tools for wallet, broker and auction applications to quickly use a *large* number of NFTs.\n\n                The transfer and accept functions\' documentation only specify conditions when the transaction MUST throw. Your implementation MAY also throw in other situations. This allows implementations to achieve interesting results:\n\n                - **Disallow transfers if the contract is paused** — prior art, CryptoKitties deployed contract, line 611\n                - **Blocklist certain address from receiving NFTs** — prior art, CryptoKitties deployed contract, lines 565, 566\n                - **Disallow unsafe transfers** — `transferFrom` throws unless `_to` equals `msg.sender` or `countOf(_to)` is non-zero or was non-zero previously (because such cases are safe)\n                - **Charge a fee to both parties of a transaction** — require payment when calling `approve` with a non-zero `_approved` if it was previously the zero address, refund payment if calling `approve` with the zero address if it was previously a non-zero address, require payment when calling any transfer function, require transfer parameter `_to` to equal `msg.sender`, require transfer parameter `_to` to be the approved address for the NFT\n                - **Read only NFT registry** — always throw from `safeTransferFrom`, `transferFrom`, `approve` and `setApprovalForAll`\n\n                Failed transactions will throw, a best practice identified in ERC-223, ERC-677, ERC-827 and OpenZeppelin\'s implementation of SafeERC20.sol. ERC-20 defined an `allowance` feature, this caused a problem when called and then later modified to a different amount, as on OpenZeppelin issue \\#438. In ERC-721, there is no allowance because every NFT is unique, the quantity is none or one. Therefore we receive the benefits of ERC-20\'s original design without problems that have been later discovered.\n\n                Creation of NFTs ("minting") and destruction of NFTs ("burning") is not included in the specification. Your contract may implement these by other means. Please see the `event` documentation for your responsibilities when creating or destroying NFTs.\n\n                We questioned if the `operator` parameter on `onERC721Received` was necessary. In all cases we could imagine, if the operator was important then that operator could transfer the token to themself and then send it -- then they would be the `from` address. This seems contrived because we consider the operator to be a temporary owner of the token (and transferring to themself is redundant). When the operator sends the token, it is the operator acting on their own accord, NOT the operator acting on behalf of the token holder. This is why the operator and the previous token owner are both significant to the token recipient.\n\n                *Alternatives considered: only allow two-step ERC-20 style transaction, require that transfer functions never throw, require all functions to return a boolean indicating the success of the operation.*\n\n                **ERC-165 Interface**\n\n                We chose Standard Interface Detection (ERC-165) to expose the interfaces that a ERC-721 smart contract supports.\n\n                A future EIP may create a global registry of interfaces for contracts. We strongly support such an EIP and it would allow your ERC-721 implementation to implement `ERC721Enumerable`, `ERC721Metadata`, or other interfaces by delegating to a separate contract.\n\n                **Gas and Complexity** (regarding the enumeration extension)\n\n                This specification contemplates implementations that manage a few and *arbitrarily large* numbers of NFTs. If your application is able to grow then avoid using for/while loops in your code (see CryptoKitties bounty issue \\#4). These indicate your contract may be unable to scale and gas costs will rise over time without bound.\n\n                We have deployed a contract, XXXXERC721, to Testnet which instantiates and tracks 340282366920938463463374607431768211456 different deeds (2^128). That\'s enough to assign every IPV6 address to an Ethereum account owner, or to track ownership of nanobots a few micron in size and in aggregate totalling half the size of Earth. You can query it from the blockchain. And every function takes less gas than querying the ENS.\n\n                This illustration makes clear: the ERC-721 standard scales.\n\n                *Alternatives considered: remove the asset enumeration function if it requires a for-loop, return a Solidity array type from enumeration functions.*\n\n                **Privacy**\n\n                Wallets/brokers/auctioneers identified in the motivation section have a strong need to identify which NFTs an owner owns.\n\n                It may be interesting to consider a use case where NFTs are not enumerable, such as a private registry of property ownership, or a partially-private registry. However, privacy cannot be attained because an attacker can simply (!) call `ownerOf` for every possible `tokenId`.\n\n                **Metadata Choices** (metadata extension)\n\n                We have required `name` and `symbol` functions in the metadata extension. Every token EIP and draft we reviewed (ERC-20, ERC-223, ERC-677, ERC-777, ERC-827) included these functions.\n\n                We remind implementation authors that the empty string is a valid response to `name` and `symbol` if you protest to the usage of this mechanism. We also remind everyone that any smart contract can use the same name and symbol as *your* contract. How a client may determine which ERC-721 smart contracts are well-known (canonical) is outside the scope of this standard.\n\n                A mechanism is provided to associate NFTs with URIs. We expect that many implementations will take advantage of this to provide metadata for each NFT. The image size recommendation is taken from Instagram, they probably know much about image usability. The URI MAY be mutable (i.e. it changes from time to time). We considered an NFT representing ownership of a house, in this case metadata about the house (image, occupants, etc.) can naturally change.\n\n                Metadata is returned as a string value. Currently this is only usable as calling from `web3`, not from other contracts. This is acceptable because we have not considered a use case where an on-blockchain application would query such information.\n\n                *Alternatives considered: put all metadata for each asset on the blockchain (too expensive), use URL templates to query metadata parts (URL templates do not work with all URL schemes, especially P2P URLs), multiaddr network address (not mature enough)*\n\n                **Community Consensus**\n\n                A significant amount of discussion occurred on the original ERC-721 issue, additionally we held a first live meeting on Gitter that had good representation and well advertised (on Reddit, in the Gitter #ERC channel, and the original ERC-721 issue). Thank you to the participants:\n\n                - [@ImAllInNow](https://github.com/imallinnow) Rob from DEC Gaming / Presenting Michigan Ethereum Meetup Feb 7\n                - [@Arachnid](https://github.com/arachnid) Nick Johnson\n                - [@jadhavajay](https://github.com/jadhavajay) Ajay Jadhav from AyanWorks\n                - [@superphly](https://github.com/superphly) Cody Marx Bailey - XRAM Capital / Sharing at hackathon Jan 20 / UN Future of Finance Hackathon.\n                - [@fulldecent](https://github.com/fulldecent) William Entriken\n\n                A second event was held at ETHDenver 2018 to discuss distinguishable asset standards (notes to be published).\n\n                We have been very inclusive in this process and invite anyone with questions or contributions into our discussion. However, this standard is written only to support the identified use cases which are listed herein.\n\n                ## Backwards Compatibility\n\n                We have adopted `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, `name` and `symbol` semantics from the ERC-20 specification. An implementation may also include a function `decimals` that returns `uint8(0)` if its goal is to be more compatible with ERC-20 while supporting this standard. However, we find it contrived to require all ERC-721 implementations to support the `decimals` function.\n\n                Example NFT implementations as of February 2018:\n\n                - CryptoKitties -- Compatible with an earlier version of this standard.\n                - CryptoPunks -- Partially ERC-20 compatible, but not easily generalizable because it includes auction functionality directly in the contract and uses function names that explicitly refer to the assets as "punks".\n                - Auctionhouse Asset Interface -- The author needed a generic interface for the Auctionhouse ÐApp (currently ice-boxed). His "Asset" contract is very simple, but is missing ERC-20 compatibility, `approve()` functionality, and metadata. This effort is referenced in the discussion for EIP-173.\n\n                Note: "Limited edition, collectible tokens" like Curio Cards and Rare Pepe are *not* distinguishable assets. They\'re actually a collection of individual fungible tokens, each of which is tracked by its own smart contract with its own total supply (which may be `1` in extreme cases).\n\n                The `onERC721Received` function specifically works around old deployed contracts which may inadvertently return 1 (`true`) in certain circumstances even if they don\'t implement a function (see Solidity DelegateCallReturnValue bug). By returning and checking for a magic value, we are able to distinguish actual affirmative responses versus these vacuous `true`s.\n\n                ## Test Cases\n\n                0xcert ERC-721 Token includes test cases written using Truffle.\n\n                ## Implementations\n\n                0xcert ERC721 -- a reference implementation\n\n                - MIT licensed, so you can freely use it for your projects\n                - Includes test cases\n                - Active bug bounty, you will be paid if you find errors\n\n                Su Squares -- an advertising platform where you can rent space and place images\n\n                - Complete the Su Squares Bug Bounty Program to seek problems with this standard or its implementation\n                - Implements the complete standard and all optional interfaces\n\n                ERC721ExampleDeed -- an example implementation\n\n                - Implements using the OpenZeppelin project format\n\n                XXXXERC721, by William Entriken -- a scalable example implementation\n\n                - Deployed on testnet with 1 billion assets and supporting all lookups with the metadata extension.

A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).\n\n                ## Abstract\n\n                This standard outlines a smart contract interface that can represent any number of fungible and non-fungible token types. Existing standards such as ERC-20 require deployment of separate contracts per token type. The ERC-721 standard\'s token ID is a single non-fungible index and the group of these non-fungibles is deployed as a single contract with settings for the entire collection. In contrast, the ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard allows for each token ID to represent a new configurable token type, which may have its own metadata, supply and other attributes.\n\n                The `_id` argument contained in each function\'s argument set indicates a specific token or token type in a transaction.\n\n                ## Motivation\n\n                Tokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each token type or collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address. With the rise of blockchain games and platforms like Enjin Coin, game developers may be creating thousands of token types, and a new type of token standard is needed to support them. However, ERC-1155 is not specific to games and many other applications can benefit from this flexibility.\n\n                New functionality is possible with this design such as transferring multiple token types at once, saving on transaction costs. Trading (escrow / atomic swaps) of multiple tokens can be built on top of this standard and it removes the need to "approve" individual token contracts separately. It is also easy to describe and mix multiple fungible or non-fungible token types in a single contract.\n\n                ## Specification\n\n                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\n\n                **Smart contracts

See "Backwards Compatibility" section.\n\n                **_Scenario#4 :_** The receiver implements the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface function(s) but returns an unknown value.\n                * The transfer MUST be reverted.\n\n                **_Scenario#5 :_** The receiver implements the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface function(s) but throws an error.\n                * The transfer MUST be reverted.\n\n                **_Scenario#6 :_** The receiver implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface and is the recipient of one and only one balance change (e.g. `safeTransferFrom` called).\n                * The balances for the transfer MUST have been updated before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called on a recipient contract.\n                * The transfer event MUST have been emitted to reflect the balance changes before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called on the recipient contract.\n                * One of `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` MUST be called on the recipient contract.\n                * The `onERC1155Received` hook SHOULD be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed.\n                    - See "onERC1155Received rules" for further rules that MUST be followed.\n                * The `onERC1155BatchReceived` hook MAY be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed.\n                    - See "onERC1155BatchReceived rules" for further rules that MUST be followed.\n\n                **_Scenario#7 :_** The receiver implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface and is the recipient of more than one balance change (e.g. `safeBatchTransferFrom` called).\n                * All balance transfers that are referenced in a call to an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook MUST be updated before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called on the recipient contract.\n                * All transfer events MUST have been emitted to reflect current balance changes before an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called on the recipient contract.\n                * `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` MUST be called on the recipient as many times as necessary such that every balance change for the recipient in the scenario is accounted for.\n                    - The return magic value for every hook call MUST be checked and acted upon as per "onERC1155Received rules" and "onERC1155BatchReceived rules".\n                * The `onERC1155BatchReceived` hook SHOULD be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed.    \n                    - See "onERC1155BatchReceived rules" for further rules that MUST be followed.\n                * The `onERC1155Received` hook MAY be called on the recipient contract and its rules followed.    \n                    - See "onERC1155Received rules" for further rules that MUST be followed.\n                    \n                **_Scenario#8 :_** You are the creator of a contract that implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface and you forward the token(s) onto another address in one or both of `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived`.\n                * Forwarding should be considered acceptance and then initiating a new `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` in a new context.\n                    - The prescribed keccak256 acceptance value magic for the receiver hook being called MUST be returned after forwarding is successful.\n                * The `_data` argument MAY be re-purposed for the new context.\n                * If forwarding fails the transaction MAY be reverted.\n                    - If the contract logic wishes to keep the ownership of the token(s) itself in this case it MAY do so.\n                    \n                **_Scenario#9 :_** You are transferring tokens via a non-standard API call i.e. an implementation specific API and NOT `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom`.\n                * In this scenario all balance updates and events output rules are the same as if a standard transfer function had been called.\n                    - i.e. an external viewer MUST still be able to query the balance via a standard function and it MUST be identical to the balance as determined by `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` events alone.\n                * If the receiver is a contract the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hooks still need to be called on it and the return values respected the same as if a standard transfer function had been called. \n                    - However while the `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions MUST revert if a receiving contract does not implement the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface, a non-standard function MAY proceed with the transfer.\n                    - See "Implementation specific transfer API rules".\n\n\n                #### Rules\n\n                **_safeTransferFrom rules:_**\n                * Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section).\n                * MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.\n                * MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent to the recipient.\n                * MUST revert on any other error.\n                * MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules" section).\n                * After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "onERC1155Received rules" section).\n                    - The `_data` argument provided by the sender for the transfer MUST be passed with its contents unaltered to the `onERC1155Received` hook function via its `_data` argument.\n\n                **_safeBatchTransferFrom rules:_**\n                * Caller must be approved to manage all the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section).\n                * MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.\n                * MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.\n                * MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.\n                * MUST revert on any other error.\n                * MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules" section).\n                * The balance changes and events MUST occur in the array order they were submitted (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).\n                * After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "onERC1155Received and onERC1155BatchReceived rules" section).\n                    - The `_data` argument provided by the sender for the transfer MUST be passed with its contents unaltered to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook function(s) via their `_data` argument.\n\n                **_TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules:_**\n                * `TransferSingle` SHOULD be used to indicate a single balance transfer has occurred between a `_from` and `_to` pair.\n                    - It MAY be emitted multiple times to indicate multiple balance changes in the transaction, but note that `TransferBatch` is designed for this to reduce gas consumption.\n                    - The `_operator` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender).\n                    - The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased.\n                    - The `_to` argument MUST be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased.\n                    - The `_id` argument MUST be the token type being transferred.\n                    - The `_value` argument MUST be the number of tokens the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by.\n                    - When minting/creating tokens, the `_from` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address). See "Minting/creating and burning/destroying rules".\n                    - When burning/destroying tokens, the `_to` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address). See "Minting/creating and burning/destroying rules".\n                * `TransferBatch` SHOULD be used to indicate multiple balance transfers have occurred between a `_from` and `_to` pair.\n                    - It MAY be emitted with a single element in the list to indicate a singular balance change in the transaction, but note that `TransferSingle` is designed for this to reduce gas consumption.\n                    - The `_operator` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender).\n                    - The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased for each entry pair in `_ids` and `_values`.\n                    - The `_to` argument MUST be the address of the recipient whose balance is increased for each entry pair in `_ids` and `_values`.\n                    - The `_ids` array argument MUST contain the ids of the tokens being transferred.\n                    - The `_values` array argument MUST contain the number of token to be transferred for each corresponding entry in `_ids`.\n                    - `_ids` and `_values` MUST have the same length.\n                    - When minting/creating tokens, the `_from` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address). See "Minting/creating and burning/destroying rules".\n                    - When burning/destroying tokens, the `_to` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address). See "Minting/creating and burning/destroying rules".\n                * The total value transferred from address `0x0` minus the total value transferred to `0x0` observed via the `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` events MAY be used by clients and exchanges to determine the "circulating supply" for a given token ID.\n                * To broadcast the existence of a token ID with no initial balance, the contract SHOULD emit the `TransferSingle` event from `0x0` to `0x0`, with the token creator as `_operator`, and a `_value` of 0.\n                * All `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` events MUST be emitted to reflect all the balance changes that have occurred before any call(s) to `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived`.\n                    - To make sure event order is correct in the case of valid re-entry (e.g. if a receiver contract forwards tokens on receipt) state balance and events balance MUST match before calling an external contract.\n\n                **_onERC1155Received rules:_**\n                - The `_operator` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender).\n                * The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased.\n                    - `_from` MUST be 0x0 for a mint.\n                * The `_id` argument MUST be the token type being transferred.\n                * The `_value` argument MUST be the number of tokens the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by.\n                * The `_data` argument MUST contain the information provided by the sender for the transfer with its contents unaltered.\n                    - i.e. it MUST pass on the unaltered `_data` argument sent via the `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` call for this transfer.\n                * The recipient contract MAY accept an increase of its balance by returning the acceptance magic value `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))`\n                    -

All callbacks represent mutually exclusive balance changes.\n                    - The set of all calls to `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` describes all balance changes that occurred during the transaction in the order submitted.\n                * A contract MAY skip calling the `onERC1155Received` hook function if the transfer operation is transferring the token to itself.\n\n                **_onERC1155BatchReceived rules:_**\n                - The `_operator` argument MUST be the address of an account/contract that is approved to make the transfer (SHOULD be msg.sender).\n                * The `_from` argument MUST be the address of the holder whose balance is decreased.\n                    - `_from` MUST be 0x0 for a mint.    \n                * The `_ids` argument MUST be the list of tokens being transferred.\n                * The `_values` argument MUST be the list of number of tokens (matching the list and order of tokens specified in `_ids`) the holder balance is decreased by and match what the recipient balance is increased by.\n                * The `_data` argument MUST contain the information provided by the sender for the transfer with its contents unaltered.\n                    - i.e. it MUST pass on the unaltered `_data` argument sent via the `safeBatchTransferFrom` call for this transfer.\n                * The recipient contract MAY accept an increase of its balance by returning the acceptance magic value `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))`\n                    - If the return value is `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))` the transfer MUST be completed or MUST revert if any other conditions are not met for success.\n                * The recipient contract MAY reject an increase of its balance by calling revert.\n                    -

All callbacks represent mutually exclusive balance changes.\n                    - The set of all calls to `onERC1155Received` and `onERC1155BatchReceived` describes all balance changes that occurred during the transaction in the order submitted.\n                * A contract MAY skip calling the `onERC1155BatchReceived` hook function if the transfer operation is transferring the token(s) to itself.\n                    \n                **_ERC1155TokenReceiver ERC-165 rules:_**\n                * The implementation of the ERC-165 `supportsInterface` function SHOULD be as follows:\n                    ```solidity\n                    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool) {\n                        return  interfaceID == 0x01ffc9a7 ||    // ERC-165 support (i.e. `bytes4(keccak256(\'supportsInterface(bytes4)\'))`).\n                                interfaceID == 0x4e2312e0;      // ERC-1155 `ERC1155TokenReceiver` support (i.e. `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)")) ^ bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))`).\n                    }\n                    ```\n                * The implementation MAY differ from the above but:\n                - It MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x01ffc9a7` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument. This signifies ERC-165 support.\n                - It MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x4e2312e0` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument. This signifies ERC-1155 `ERC1155TokenReceiver` support.\n                - It MUST NOT consume more than 10,000 gas.\n                    - This keeps it below the ERC-165 requirement of 30,000 gas, reduces the gas reserve needs and minimises possible side-effects of gas exhaustion during the call.\n\n                **_Implementation specific transfer API rules:_**\n                * If an implementation specific API function is used to transfer ERC-1155 token(s) to a contract, the `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` (as appropriate) rules MUST still be followed if the receiver implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface. If it does not the non-standard implementation SHOULD revert but MAY proceed.    \n                * An example:\n                    1. An approved user calls a function such as `function myTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values);`.\n                    2. `myTransferFrom` updates the balances for `_from` and `_to` addresses for all `_ids` and `_values`.\n                    3. `myTransferFrom` emits `TransferBatch` with the details of what was transferred from address `_from` to address `_to`.\n                    4. `myTransferFrom` checks if `_to` is a contract address and determines that it is so (if not, then the transfer can be considered successful).\n                    5. `myTransferFrom` calls `onERC1155BatchReceived` on `_to` and it reverts or returns an unknown value (if it had returned `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))` the transfer can be considered successful).    \n                    6. At this point `myTransferFrom` SHOULD revert the transaction immediately as receipt of the token(s) was not explicitly accepted by the `onERC1155BatchReceived` function.            \n                    7. If however `myTransferFrom` wishes to continue it MUST call `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` on `_to` and if it returns the constant value `true` the transaction MUST be reverted, as it is now known to be a valid receiver and the previous acceptance step failed. \n                        - NOTE: You could have called `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` at a previous step if you wanted to gather and act upon that information earlier, such as in a hybrid standards scenario.\n                    8. If the above call to `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` on `_to` reverts or returns a value other than the constant value `true` the `myTransferFrom` function MAY consider this transfer successful.\n                        - __NOTE__: this MAY result in unrecoverable tokens if sent to an address that does not expect to receive ERC-1155 tokens.\n                * The above example is not exhaustive but illustrates the major points (and shows that most are shared with `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`):\n                    - Balances that are updated MUST have equivalent transfer events emitted.\n                    - A receiver address has to be checked if it is a contract and if so relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook function(s) have to be called on it. \n                    - Balances (and events associated) that are referenced in a call to an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook MUST be updated (and emitted) before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called.\n                    - The return values of the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook functions that are called MUST be respected if they are implemented.    \n                    - Only non-standard transfer functions MAY allow tokens to be sent to a recipient contract that does NOT implement the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook functions. `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` MUST revert in that case (unless it is a hybrid standards implementation see "Backwards Compatibility").\n\n                **_Minting/creating and burning/destroying rules:_**\n                * A mint/create operation is essentially a specialized transfer and MUST follow these rules:\n                    - To broadcast the existence of a token ID with no initial balance, the contract SHOULD emit the `TransferSingle` event from `0x0` to `0x0`, with the token creator as `_operator`, and a `_value` of 0.\n                    - The "TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules" MUST be followed as appropriate for the mint(s) (i.e. singles or batches) however the `_from` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address) to flag the transfer as a mint to contract observers.\n                        - __NOTE:__ This includes tokens that are given an initial balance in the contract. The balance of the contract MUST also be able to be determined by events alone meaning initial contract balances (for eg. in construction) MUST emit events to reflect those balances too.            \n                * A burn/destroy operation is essentially a specialized transfer and MUST follow these rules:\n                    - The "TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules" MUST be followed as appropriate for the burn(s) (i.e. singles or batches) however the `_to` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address) to flag the transfer as a burn to contract observers.           \n                    - When burning/destroying you do not have to actually transfer to `0x0` (that is impl specific), only the `_to` argument in the event MUST be set to `0x0` as above.\n                * The total value transferred from address `0x0` minus the total value transferred to `0x0` observed via the `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` events MAY be used by clients and exchanges to determine the "circulating supply" for a given token ID.\n                * As mentioned above mint/create and burn/destroy operations are specialized transfers and so will likely be accomplished with custom transfer functions rather than `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom`. If so the "Implementation specific transfer API rules" section would be appropriate.   \n                    - Even in a non-safe API and/or hybrid standards case the above event rules MUST still be adhered to when minting/creating or burning/destroying.\n                * A contract MAY skip calling the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook function(s) if the mint operation is transferring the token(s) to itself. In all other cases the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` rules MUST be followed as appropriate for the implementation (i.e. safe, custom and/or hybrid). \n\n\n                ##### A solidity example of the keccak256 generated constants for the various magic values (these MAY be used by implementation):\n\n                ```solidity\n                bytes4 constant public ERC1155_ERC165 = 0xd9b67a26; // ERC-165 identifier for the main token standard.\n                bytes4 constant public ERC1155_ERC165_TOKENRECEIVER = 0x4e2312e0; // ERC-165 identifier for the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` support (i.e. `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)")) ^ bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))`).\n                bytes4 constant public ERC1155_ACCEPTED = 0xf23a6e61; // Return value from `onERC1155Received` call if a contract accepts receipt (i.e `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))`).\n                bytes4 constant public ERC1155_BATCH_ACCEPTED = 0xbc197c81; // Return value from `onERC1155BatchReceived` call if a contract accepts receipt (i.e `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))`).\n                ```\n\n                ### Metadata\n\n                The URI value allows for ID substitution by clients. If the string `{id}` exists in any URI, clients MUST replace this with the actual token ID in hexadecimal form. This allows for a large number of tokens to use the same on-chain string by defining a URI once, for that large number of tokens.\n\n                * The string format of the substituted hexadecimal ID MUST be lowercase alphanumeric: `[0-9a-f]` with no 0x prefix.\n                * The string format of the substituted hexadecimal ID MUST be leading zero padded to 64 hex characters length if necessary.\n\n                Example of such a URI: `https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json` would be replaced with `https://token-cdn-domain/000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004cce0.json` if the client is referring to token ID 314592/0x4CCE0.\n\n                #### Metadata Extensions\n\n                The optional `ERC1155Metadata_URI` extension can be identified with the [ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection](./eip-165.md).\n\n                If the optional `ERC1155Metadata_URI` extension is included:\n                * The ERC-165 `supportsInterface` function MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x0e89341c` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.\n                * _Changes_ to the URI MUST emit the `URI` event if the change can be expressed with an event (i.e. it isn\'t dynamic/programmatic).\n                    - An implementation MAY emit the `URI` event during a mint operation but it is NOT mandatory. An observer MAY fetch the metadata uri at mint time from the `uri` function if it was not emitted.    \n                * The `uri` function SHOULD be used to retrieve values if no event was emitted. \n                * The `uri` function MUST return the same value as the latest event for an `_id` if it was emitted.\n                * The `uri` function MUST NOT be used to check for the existence of a token as it is possible for an implementation to return a valid string even if the token does not exist.\n\n                ```solidity\n                pragma solidity ^0.5.9;\n\n                /**\n                    Note: The ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x0e89341c.\n                */\n                interface ERC1155Metadata_URI {\n                    /**\n                        @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given token.\n                        @dev URIs are defined in RFC 3986.\n                        The URI MUST point to a JSON file that conforms to the "ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema".        \n                        @return URI string\n                    */\n                    function uri(uint256 _id) external view returns (string memory);\n                }\n                ```\n\n                #### ERC-1155 Metadata URI JSON Schema\n\n                This JSON schema is loosely based on the "ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema", but includes optional formatting to allow for ID substitution by clients.

As such, a simple overlay method is proposed to enable localization. If the metadata JSON file contains a `localization` attribute, its content MAY be used to provide localized values for fields that need it. The `localization` attribute should be a sub-object with three attributes: `uri`, `default` and `locales`. If the string `{locale}` exists in any URI, it MUST be replaced with the chosen locale by all client software.\n\n                ##### JSON Schema\n\n                ```json\n                {\n                    "title": "Token Metadata",\n                    "type": "object",\n                    "properties": {\n                        "name": {\n                            "type": "string",\n                            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this token represents",\n                        },\n                        "decimals": {\n                            "type": "integer",\n                            "description": "The number of decimal places that the token amount should display - e.g. 18, means to divide the token amount by 1000000000000000000 to get its user representation."\n                        },\n                        "description": {\n                            "type": "string",\n                            "description": "Describes the asset to which this token represents"\n                        },\n                        "image": {\n                            "type": "string",\n                            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this token represents.

To permit approval of a subset of token IDs, an interface such as [ERC-1761 Scoped Approval Interface](./eip-1761.md) is suggested.\n                The counterpart `isApprovedForAll` provides introspection into any status set by `setApprovalForAll`.\n\n                An owner SHOULD be assumed to always be able to operate on their own tokens regardless of approval status, so should SHOULD NOT have to call `setApprovalForAll` to approve themselves as an operator before they can operate on them.  \n\n                ## Rationale\n\n                ### Metadata Choices\n\n                The `symbol` function (found in the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards) was not included as we do not believe this is a globally useful piece of data to identify a generic virtual item / asset and are also prone to collisions. Short-hand symbols are used in tickers and currency trading, but they aren\'t as useful outside of that space.\n\n                The `name` function (for human-readable asset names, on-chain) was removed from the standard to allow the Metadata JSON to be the definitive asset name and reduce duplication of data. This also allows localization for names, which would otherwise be prohibitively expensive if each language string was stored on-chain, not to mention bloating the standard interface. While this decision may add a small burden on implementers to host a JSON file containing metadata, we believe any serious implementation of ERC-1155 will already utilize JSON Metadata.\n\n                ### Upgrades\n\n                The requirement to emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` on balance change implies that a valid implementation of ERC-1155 redeploying to a new contract address MUST emit events from the new contract address to replicate the deprecated contract final state. It is valid to only emit a minimal number of events to reflect only the final balance and omit all the transactions that led to that state. The event emit requirement is to ensure that the current state of the contract can always be traced only through events. To alleviate the need to emit events when changing contract address, consider using the proxy pattern, such as described in [EIP-2535](./eip-2535.md). This will also have the added benefit of providing a stable contract address for users.\n\n                ### Design decision: Supporting non-batch\n\n                The standard supports `safeTransferFrom` and `onERC1155Received` functions because they are significantly cheaper for single token-type transfers, which is arguably a common use case.\n\n                ### Design decision: Safe transfers only\n\n                The standard only supports safe-style transfers, making it possible for receiver contracts to depend on `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` function to be always called at the end of a transfer.\n\n                ### Guaranteed log trace\n\n                As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, many dapps are relying on traditional databases and explorer API services to retrieve and categorize data. The ERC-1155 standard guarantees that event logs emitted by the smart contract will provide enough data to create an accurate record of all current token balances. A database or explorer may listen to events and be able to provide indexed and categorized searches of every ERC-1155 token in the contract.\n\n                ### Approval\n\n                The function `setApprovalForAll` allows an operator to manage one\'s entire set of tokens on behalf of the approver. It enables frictionless interaction with exchange and trade contracts.\n\n                Restricting approval to a certain set of token IDs, quantities or other rules MAY be done with an additional interface or an external contract. The rationale is to keep the ERC-1155 standard as generic as possible for all use-cases without imposing a specific approval scheme on implementations that may not need it. Standard token approval interfaces can be used, such as the suggested [ERC-1761 Scoped Approval Interface](./eip-1761.md) which is compatible with ERC-1155.\n\n                ## Backwards Compatibility\n\n                There have been requirements during the design discussions to have this standard be compatible with existing standards when sending to contract addresses, specifically ERC-721 at time of writing.\n                To cater for this scenario, there is some leeway with the revert logic should a contract not implement the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` as per "Safe Transfer Rules" section above, specifically "Scenario#3 : The receiver does not implement the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface function(s)".\n\n                Hence in a hybrid ERC-1155 contract implementation an extra call MUST be made on the recipient contract and checked before any hook calls to `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` are made.\n                Order of operation MUST therefore be:\n                1. The implementation MUST call the function `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` on the recipient contract, providing at least 10,000 gas.\n                2. If the function call succeeds and the return value is the constant value `true` the implementation proceeds as a regular ERC-1155 implementation, with the call(s) to the `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` hooks and rules associated.\n                3. If the function call fails or the return value is NOT the constant value `true` the implementation can assume the recipient contract is not an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` and follow its other standard\'s rules for transfers. \n                \n                *__Note that a pure implementation of a single standard is recommended__* rather than a hybrid solution, but an example of a hybrid ERC-1155/ERC-721 contract is linked in the references section under implementations.\n\n                An important consideration is that even if the tokens are sent with another standard\'s rules the *__ERC-1155 transfer events MUST still be emitted.__* This is so the balances can still be determined via events alone as per ERC-1155 standard rules.\n\n                ## Usage\n\n                This standard can be used to represent multiple token types for an entire domain. Both fungible and non-fungible tokens can be stored in the same smart-contract.\n\n                ### Batch Transfers\n\n                The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function allows for batch transfers of multiple token IDs and values. The design of ERC-1155 makes batch transfers possible without the need for a wrapper contract, as with existing token standards. This reduces gas costs when more than one token type is included in a batch transfer, as compared to single transfers with multiple transactions.\n\n                Another advantage of standardized batch transfers is the ability for a smart contract to respond to the batch transfer in a single operation using `onERC1155BatchReceived`.\n\n                It is RECOMMENDED that clients and wallets sort the token IDs and associated values (in ascending order) when posting a batch transfer, as some ERC-1155 implementations offer significant gas cost savings when IDs are sorted. See [Horizon Games - Multi-Token Standard](https://github.com/horizon-games/multi-token-standard) "packed balance" implementation for an example of this.\n\n                ### Batch Balance\n\n                The `balanceOfBatch` function allows clients to retrieve balances of multiple owners and token IDs with a single call.\n\n                ### Enumerating from events\n\n                In order to keep storage requirements light for contracts implementing ERC-1155, enumeration (discovering the IDs and values of tokens) must be done using event logs. It is RECOMMENDED that clients such as exchanges and blockchain explorers maintain a local database containing the token ID, Supply, and URI at the minimum. This can be built from each TransferSingle, TransferBatch, and URI event, starting from the block the smart contract was deployed until the latest block.\n\n                ERC-1155 contracts must therefore carefully emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` events in any instance where tokens are created, minted, transferred or destroyed.\n\n                ### Non-Fungible Tokens\n\n                The following strategies are examples of how you MAY mix fungible and non-fungible tokens together in the same contract. The standard does NOT mandate how an implementation must do this. \n\n                ##### Split ID bits\n\n                The top 128 bits of the uint256 `_id` parameter in any ERC-1155 function MAY represent the base token ID, while the bottom 128 bits MAY represent the index of the non-fungible to make it unique.\n\n                Non-fungible tokens can be interacted with using an index based accessor into the contract/token data set. Therefore to access a particular token set within a mixed data contract and a particular non-fungible within that set, `_id` could be passed as `<uint128: base token id><uint128: index of non-fungible>`.\n\n                To identify a non-fungible set/category as a whole (or a fungible) you COULD just pass in the base id via the `_id` argument as `<uint128: base token id><uint128: zero>`. If your implementation uses this technique this naturally means the index of a non-fungible SHOULD be 1-based.\n\n                Inside the contract code the two pieces of data needed to access the individual non-fungible can be extracted with uint128(~0) and the same mask shifted by 128.\n\n                ```solidity\n                uint256 baseTokenNFT = 12345 << 128;\n                uint128 indexNFT = 50;\n\n                uint256 baseTokenFT = 54321 << 128;\n\n                balanceOf(msg.sender, baseTokenNFT); // Get balance of the base token for non-fungible set 12345 (this MAY be used to get balance of the user for all of this token set if the implementation wishes as a convenience).\n                balanceOf(msg.sender, baseTokenNFT + indexNFT); // Get balance of the token at index 50 for non-fungible set 12345 (should be 1 if user owns the individual non-fungible token or 0 if they do not).\n                balanceOf(msg.sender, baseTokenFT); // Get balance of the fungible base token 54321.\n                ```\n\n                Note that 128 is an arbitrary number, an implementation MAY choose how they would like this split to occur as suitable for their use case. An observer of the contract would simply see events showing balance transfers and mints happening and MAY track the balances using that information alone.\n                For an observer to be able to determine type (non-fungible or fungible) from an ID alone they would have to know the split ID bits format on a implementation by implementation basis.\n\n                The [ERC-1155 Reference Implementation](https://github.com/enjin/erc-1155) is an example of the split ID bits strategy.\n\n                ##### Natural Non-Fungible tokens\n\n                Another simple way to represent non-fungibles is to allow a maximum value of 1 for each non-fungible token. This would naturally mirror the real world, where unique items have a quantity of 1 and fungible items have a quantity greater than 1.\n\n            </eip>\n            '), type='text')], created_at=1717435712, incomplete_at=None, incomplete_details=None, metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='user', run_id=None, status=None, thread_id='thread_Kr6OmZnucZFyJvKhparISwyY')], object='list', first_id='msg_Ic3jkkJJN2DVYYrG6opyUYUr', last_id='msg_3Uh7KnaNPUm4xr6x7LI9tnu5', has_more=False)
