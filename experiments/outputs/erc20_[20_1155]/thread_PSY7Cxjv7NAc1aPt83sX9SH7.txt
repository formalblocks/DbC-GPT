Do not exceed this limit under any circumstances.\n            - Position: add the solc-verify annotation above the related function, example:\n                /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply\n                function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);\n            - Output format: return the annotated interface inside code fence (```) to show the code block. RETURN JUST THE CONTRACT ANNOTATED, NOTHING MORE.\n\n            Guidance for Generating Postconditions:\n\n            - State Changes: Reflect how state variables change. For example, ownership transfer should reflect changes in token ownership and balances.\n            - Conditions on Input: Consider how inputs affect the state variables.\n            - Reset Conditions: Ensure certain variables are reset after the function execution, if applicable.\n\n            ERC interface example:\n            ```solidity\n                contract ERC1155  {\n                    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance  \n                    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view   returns (uint256 balance);\n                    \n                    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length \n                    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _ids.length\n                    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) !( 0 <= x &&  x < batchBalances.length ) || batchBalances[x] == _balances[_ids[x]][_owners[x]]\n                    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);\n\n                    /// @notice  postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] ==  _approved \n                    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;\n\n                    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved\n                    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);\n\n                    /// @notice postcondition _to != address(0) \n                    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender] || _from == msg.sender\n                    /// @notice postcondition __verifier_old_uint ( _balances[_id][_from] ) >= _value    \n                    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint ( _balances[_id][_from] ) -
