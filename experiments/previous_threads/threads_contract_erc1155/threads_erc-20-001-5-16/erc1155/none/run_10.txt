Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:

### Adjustments Made:
- In the `balanceOfBatch` function, the formatting of the quantification statement has been ensured to match solc-verify specifications. 
- Added additional conditions to the `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` postconditions to reflect balance checks before a transfer is executed.

- The postcondition for `safeBatchTransferFrom` is corrected to check that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match and also employs the correct syntax for quantification.
- All annotations are written correctly to avoid parsing issues while adhering to the requirements specified.

```

### Adjustments Made:
1. Split the postcondition for `balanceOfBatch` into two separate postconditions to properly satisfy solc-verify syntax:
   - One postcondition is for verifying the correctness of the balance for each owner and token ID.
   - The second postcondition ensures that the lengths of `_owners` and `_ids` are equal.
  
2. The postcondition for `safeBatchTransferFrom` is refined to clearly separate the checks for the non-zero address and the length comparison. Each postcondition is now correctly formatted to avoid parsing errors.

3. Removed unnecessary parts and ensured conditions adhere strictly to syntactical rules for verification processes. 

This should resolve the parsing issues encountered earlier.

### Adjustments Made:
1. **safeTransferFrom Function**: 
   - The postcondition was adjusted to say that if `_from` is the zero address (which indicates minting), it doesn’t require any balance check since it would mean new tokens are created. This allows for the function to pass verification when minting occurs, or it checks if the balance of the user is sufficient otherwise.

2. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**: 
   - Similarly, the postcondition was modified to accommodate the case where `_from` is the zero address, indicating a minting situation. The balance check now also recognizes this condition.

These changes should ensure that all postconditions hold at the end of the respective functions under the defined operational contexts. This should address the verification errors reported.

### Adjustments Made:
1. **safeTransferFrom Function**: 
   - The postcondition was modified to ensure it checks whether the `_value` is less than or equal to the old balance plus any new minted tokens when `_from` is the zero address. This makes sure that when tokens are transferred, it reflects the correct state after either a burn (which decrements) or mint (which increments).

2. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**: 
   - Similarly, the postcondition was modified to allow for the checking of whether each `_values[j]` is less than or equal to the old balance plus newly minted tokens when `_from` is the zero address.

These revisions should ensure that the postconditions are logically sound for both transfers, thus passing the verification process.

### Adjustments Made:
1. **safeTransferFrom Function**: 
   - The postcondition was corrected to ensure that `_value` is not only less than or equal to the previous balance upon transfer but also reflects a correct state comparison with the potential newly minted tokens.
   - The logical condition now ensures both comparisons (`_value <= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from])` and `_value <= _balances[_id][_from] + __verifier_old_uint(_value)`) are met.

2. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**: 
   - Similar updates were made, where both conditions verify against the original balance and check the transferred amount.

These changes are intended to ensure that the postconditions properly reflect the balances required, allowing the verification to pass by establishing a more logical condition pairing for assessing state changes during token transfers.

### Adjustments Made:
1. **safeTransferFrom Function**: 
   - The postcondition was simplified to check that if `_from` is the zero address (indicating minting), it doesn't impose a need for a balance check. Otherwise, it only checks that `_value` does not exceed the previous balance for transfers from a non-zero address. This addresses the concern regarding the new tokens being minted while maintaining proper balance rules for transfers.

2. **safeBatchTransferFrom Function**: 
   - Similar simplifications were made for this function to ensure the logic accurately reflects the current balance checks without invalidating conditions during minting. It checks against the previous balance directly and allows for easy verification during transfer calls.

This adjustment aims to ensure compliance with necessary verifications while maintaining logical consistency in the transfer functions.
