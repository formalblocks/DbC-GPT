=== USER [2025-05-15 20:59:45] ===
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
    MUST revert on any other error.
    MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

Here is the annotated function with the appropriate postconditions added:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **First Postcondition**: Ensures that the balance of the `_from` address for the token `_id` decreases by `_value` after the transfer.
2. **Second Postcondition**: Ensures that the balance of the `_to` address for the token `_id` increases by `_value` after the transfer. 

These postconditions reflect the expected state changes in the `_balances` mapping as a result of the `safeTransferFrom` function execution.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-15 21:00:17] ===
The error indicates that the postcondition for the `_from` balance may not hold at the end of the function. This is likely due to the possibility of the `_to` address being a smart contract that may reject the transfer, which would leave the balance of `_from` unchanged.

To address this, we need to modify the postconditions to account for the scenario where the transfer might not occur if the recipient is a smart contract that does not accept the tokens. We can use a conditional postcondition to reflect this.

Here’s the updated function with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
    @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
    MUST revert on any other error.
    MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).        
    @param _from    Source address
    @param _to      Target address
    @param _id      ID of the token type
    @param _value   Transfer amount
    @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to `onERC1155Received` on `_to`
*/

/// @notice postcondition _to == address(0) || __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) >= _value ==> _balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value
/// @notice postcondition _to == address(0) || __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) >= _value ==> _balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Conditional Postconditions**: 
   - The first postcondition now checks if `_to` is not the zero address and if the old balance of `_from` for token `_id` is greater than or equal to `_value`. If both conditions are true, it asserts that the balance of `_from` decreases by `_value`.
   - The second postcondition similarly checks the same conditions and asserts that the balance of `_to` increases by `_value`.

This way, if the transfer fails (for example, if `_to` is a smart contract that rejects the transfer), the postconditions will still hold true, as the balances will remain unchanged.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-15 21:00:36] ===
The errors indicate that the postconditions are not being parsed correctly due to the use of the implication operator (`==>`), which is not allowed in solc-verify annotations. We need to rewrite the postconditions to avoid using this operator while still maintaining the intended logic.

We can achieve this by using logical negation to express the conditions without implications. Here’s the corrected version of the function with properly formatted postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
    @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
    MUST revert on any other error.
    MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).        
    @param _from    Source address
    @param _to      Target address
    @param _id      ID of the token type
    @param _value   Transfer amount
    @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to `onERC1155Received` on `_to`
*/

/// @notice postcondition !(address(0) == _to || __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) < _value) || _balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value
/// @notice postcondition !(address(0) == _to || __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) < _value) || _balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Logical Negation**: 
   - The first postcondition now states that if `_to` is not the zero address and the old balance of `_from` for token `_id` is greater than or equal to `_value`, then the balance of `_from` must decrease by `_value`.
   - The second postcondition follows the same logic for the balance of `_to`.

By using logical negation, we ensure that the postconditions are valid according to the solc-verify syntax, while still capturing the necessary conditions for the state changes that occur during the function execution.
