INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.

        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}

        ```

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:

    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)

        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    /**

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

INFO:root:trying again with solc-verify output: 
        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    /**

    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
