        Instructions:
        - Function Bodies: The specification must not contain function implementations.
        - Postconditions Limit: Each function must have at most 4 postcondition (/// @notice postcondition) annotations above the function signature. Do not exceed this limit under any circumstances.
        - Position: add the solc-verify annotation above the related function, example:
            /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
            function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);
        - Output format: return the annotated interface inside code fence (```) to show the code block. RETURN JUST THE CONTRACT ANNOTATED, NOTHING MORE.
