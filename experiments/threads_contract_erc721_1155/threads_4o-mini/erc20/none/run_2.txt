=== USER [2025-05-21 22:21:57] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:

    
    ```solidity

    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-21 22:22:29] ===
To address the verification errors, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. The errors indicate that the postconditions may not hold due to the possibility of insufficient balance or allowance, which would cause the function to revert before reaching the state changes.

We can modify the postconditions to account for the case where the transfer does not occur (i.e., when the function fails due to insufficient balance or allowance). We will use the `!(condition) || condition` format to ensure that the postconditions are valid even when the transfer does not happen.

Here is the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition !(0 <= _value) || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)
    /// @notice postcondition !(0 <= _value) || success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition !(0 <= _value) || (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)
    /// @notice postcondition !(0 <= _value) || (_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value)
    /// @notice postcondition !(0 <= _value) || success
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

In this updated version, the postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` now check that if `_value` is greater than or equal to zero, then the balances and allowances must reflect the expected changes. If the transfer does not occur (due to insufficient balance or allowance), the postconditions will still hold true.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions account for the possibility that the transfer may not occur due to insufficient balance or allowance. The previous conditions were not sufficient to guarantee that the state would reflect the expected changes.

We can modify the postconditions to ensure that they only apply when the transfer is successful. Specifically, we can check that the balances and allowances are only updated if the transfer is successful. We will also ensure that the postconditions do not assume the transfer will always happen.

Here is the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:** 
   - The postconditions now check that if the transfer is successful (`success` is true), then the balances and allowances are updated accordingly.
   - If the transfer is not successful (e.g., due to insufficient balance or allowance), the postcondition will hold true as it does not impose any state change requirements.

This should ensure that the postconditions are valid and will pass the verification process.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-21 22:23:33] ===
To resolve the verification errors, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to ensure they accurately reflect the state changes only when the transfer is successful. The previous conditions were too strict and did not account for the fact that the function could revert before reaching the state changes.

We can modify the postconditions to ensure that they only apply when the transfer is successful and to avoid making assumptions about the success of the transfer when `_value` is zero or negative. Specifically, we will check that if the transfer is successful, the balances and allowances are updated accordingly, and if the transfer is not successful, we will not impose any conditions on the state changes.

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:** 
   - The postconditions now use `success ==>` to indicate that the balance changes only apply if the transfer was successful. This means that if the transfer fails, the postconditions do not impose any conditions on the state changes.
   - The condition `!(0 <= _value) || success` remains to ensure that if `_value` is zero or negative, the success of the transfer does not affect the postconditions.

This should ensure that the postconditions are valid and will pass the verification process.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-21 22:23:56] ===
The errors you're encountering indicate that the use of `success ==>` in the postconditions is not valid syntax for solc-verify annotations. Instead, we need to express the postconditions in a way that does not use implications but still captures the necessary conditions for state changes.

To fix the postconditions, we can use the format `!(condition) || condition` to express the desired behavior without using implications. This means we will state that if the transfer is successful, then the balances must reflect the changes; otherwise, we do not impose any conditions.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:**
   - Changed the postconditions to use `!(success) ||` instead of `success ==>`. This format checks that if the transfer is successful, then the balances must reflect the expected changes. If the transfer is not successful, the postcondition does not impose any conditions on the state changes.

This should resolve the syntax errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid for solc-verify.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the state changes that occur only when the transfers are successful. The previous conditions were not sufficient to guarantee that the state would reflect the expected changes, especially in cases where the function may revert due to insufficient balance or allowance.

We can modify the postconditions to ensure that they only apply when the transfer is successful and to avoid making assumptions about the success of the transfer when `_value` is zero or negative. We will express the postconditions in a way that allows for the possibility of the transfer failing without imposing any conditions on the state changes.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to ensure they accurately reflect the state changes only when the transfers are successful. The errors indicate that the postconditions may not hold if the transfer fails, particularly when `_value` is zero or negative.

We can modify the postconditions to explicitly state that the balance changes only apply when the transfer is successful and to ensure that the conditions are valid regardless of the value of `_value`. We can also ensure that the conditions do not impose any requirements when the transfer is not successful.

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now include an additional condition that checks if the transfer is not successful (i.e., if it fails), then the balances remain unchanged. This ensures that if the transfer does not occur, the state remains as it was before the function call.
   - This effectively handles the case where the transfer might fail due to insufficient balance or allowance, ensuring that the postconditions will hold true regardless of the outcome.

This should ensure that the postconditions are valid and will pass the verification process.

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now use the implication operator `success ==>` to indicate that the balance changes only apply if the transfer was successful. This means that if the transfer fails, the postconditions do not impose any conditions on the state changes.
   - The condition `!(0 <= _value) || success` remains to ensure that if `_value` is zero or negative, the success of the transfer does not affect the postconditions.

This should ensure that the postconditions are valid and will pass the verification process.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-21 22:26:39] ===
To resolve the verification errors, we need to avoid using the implication operator (`==>`) in the postconditions, as it is not supported in the solc-verify syntax. Instead, we can express the postconditions using the format `!(condition) || condition`, which effectively captures the same logic without using implications.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition !(0 <= _value) || (success && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)
    /// @notice postcondition !(0 <= _value) || (!success && _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition !(0 <= _value) || (success && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)
    /// @notice postcondition !(0 <= _value) || (!success && _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now use the format `!(0 <= _value) || (success && ...)` to indicate that if `_value` is non-negative, then the balances must reflect the expected changes if the transfer is successful.
   - Additionally, the postconditions include a condition for when the transfer is not successful, ensuring that the balances remain unchanged.

This should ensure that the postconditions are valid and will pass the verification process without using unsupported syntax.
