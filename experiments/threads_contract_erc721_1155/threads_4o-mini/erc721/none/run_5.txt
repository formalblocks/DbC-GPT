=== USER [2025-05-23 01:33:18] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-23 01:34:04] ===
Certainly! The error indicates that the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function references an undeclared variable `isApproved`. Instead, we should directly return the value of the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` as the return value of the function. Let's fix that and ensure all postconditions are correctly specified.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

In this version, the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` has been corrected to ensure it references the mapping directly without introducing an undeclared variable. All other postconditions remain unchanged and valid.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-23 01:34:58] ===
To address the verification errors, we need to refine the postconditions based on the expected behavior of the functions. Here are the changes we will make:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The postcondition `balance >= 0` is unnecessary since the return value is derived from the `_ownedTokensCount` mapping, which cannot be negative. We can remove this condition.

2. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The postcondition `forall (bool isApproved) (isApproved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator])` is incorrect because it introduces a quantified variable that is not necessary. Instead, we can directly assert that the return value of the function matches the mapping.

3. **`transferFrom`**: The postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` might not hold if the `_from` address is the zero address or if the token is not owned by `_from`. We need to ensure that the postcondition only applies if `_from` is indeed the owner of the token being transferred.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

### Key Changes:
- Removed the unnecessary postcondition from `balanceOf`.
- Updated the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` to directly reference the mapping without quantification.
- Modified the postconditions for `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`, and the other transfer function to account for the ownership checks, ensuring that the changes to `_ownedTokensCount` only apply if the sender is indeed the owner or the new owner.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors.

- The postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` has been corrected to `postcondition return == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`, which properly references the return value of the function without syntax errors.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the contract interface is correctly specified.

The verification errors indicate that the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function is incorrectly specified. The syntax used to reference the return value is not valid. Instead of using `return`, we should use the function's return variable name, which is `approved`.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-23 01:37:22] ===
The verification error for the `transferFrom` function indicates that the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` might not hold at the end of the function. This is likely because the `_from` address may not be the actual owner of the token being transferred, which would prevent the decrement of the `_ownedTokensCount`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the postcondition for `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` only applies if `_from` is indeed the owner of the token being transferred. We can use a conditional expression to check if the transfer is valid.

### Key Changes:
- The postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` and `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` in the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions have been modified to use conditional expressions. They now check if `msg.sender` is the owner or the new owner, respectively, before applying the increment or decrement.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under the expected conditions of the function execution, thus resolving the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-23 01:38:21] ===
The verification errors indicate that the postconditions for the `transferFrom` function may not hold true under all circumstances. Specifically, the conditions that check the ownership of the token and the changes to `_ownedTokensCount` need to be more robust.

To address this, we need to ensure that the postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` and `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` are only applied when the transfer is valid. This means we should check if `_from` is indeed the owner of the token being transferred. If the transfer is not valid (e.g., if `_from` is not the owner), we should not assume any changes to the counts.

### Key Changes:
- The postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` and `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` in the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions have been modified to include conditions that check if `_from` is indeed the owner of the token and if `_to` is not the zero address. This ensures that the postconditions only apply when the transfer is valid.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under the expected conditions of the function execution, thus resolving the verification errors.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-23 01:39:11] ===
The verification errors indicate that the conditional expressions used in the postconditions are incorrectly formatted. Specifically, the `if` statements cannot be used directly in the postconditions as they are not valid syntax in the context of solc-verify annotations.

To resolve this, we need to use logical expressions that can be evaluated without the `if` statement. We can use the logical AND operator (`&&`) to conditionally apply the changes to `_ownedTokensCount` based on whether the conditions are met.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

The conditions now use logical AND (`&&`) to ensure that the changes only apply when the conditions are met.

These adjustments should resolve the syntax errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid for the verification process.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-23 01:40:12] ===
The verification error for the `transferFrom` function indicates that the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - (msg.sender == _from && _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] ? 1 : 0)` might not hold true. This is likely because the decrement of `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` assumes that `msg.sender` is the owner of the token, but the transfer may not be valid if the ownership conditions are not met.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the postcondition for `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` only applies if `_from` is indeed the owner of the token being transferred. We can achieve this by checking that the ownership condition is satisfied before applying the decrement.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the revised postconditions:

### Key Changes:
- The postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` and `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` in the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions have been modified to ensure that the decrement and increment only apply if the ownership conditions are satisfied. The conditions are still expressed in a way that allows for the verification process to check their validity.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under the expected conditions of the function execution, thus resolving the verification errors.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-23 01:41:16] ===
The verification error for the `transferFrom` function indicates that the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - (msg.sender == _from && _from == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] ? 1 : 0)` might not hold true. This is likely because the postcondition assumes that the transfer is valid and that `msg.sender` is indeed the owner of the token.

To ensure that the postcondition holds true, we need to adjust the logic so that it only applies when the transfer is valid. Specifically, we should check that `_from` is the actual owner of the token before applying the decrement to `_ownedTokensCount[_from]`. If the transfer is invalid, we should not assume any changes to the count.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the revised postconditions:
