=== USER [2025-03-30 13:42:29] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

In the postcondition for the `transfer` function, the condition that checks the balance of `_to` and `_from` accounts after the transfer has been specified correctly. The postcondition for `transferFrom` has also been specified correctly, ensuring that the allowances are updated accordingly.

In this specification, the postcondition for the `transfer` function ensures that after the transfer, the balance of `_to` has increased by `_value`, and the balance of `msg.sender` has decreased by `_value`. 

Similarly, the postcondition for `transferFrom` ensures that the balance of `_to` has increased by `_value` and the balance of `_from` has decreased by `_value`. Additionally, it verifies that the allowance for the sender has been decreased by `_value`.

The postcondition for `approve` ensures that the allowance for `_spender` has been set to `_value` for the caller.

The postcondition for `balanceOf` directly relates to the `_balances` mapping, ensuring that it returns the correct balance for the specified `_owner`.

The postcondition for `allowance` ensures that it returns the correct remaining allowance for `_spender` from `_owner`.

### Explanation of postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition states that the total supply of tokens is equal to the `supply` variable.
   
2. **transfer**: The postcondition states that after the transfer, the balance of `_to` has increased by `_value` and the balance of `msg.sender` has decreased by `_value`.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition states that after the transfer, the balance of `_to` has increased by `_value`, the balance of `_from` has decreased by `_value`, and the allowance for `msg.sender` to withdraw from `_from` has decreased by `_value`.

4. **approve**: The postcondition states that the allowance for `_spender` is now equal to `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition states that the balance of `_owner` is equal to the `balance` variable.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition states that the allowance for `_spender` from `_owner` is equal to `remaining`.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is consistent with the ERC20 standard and that the state variables reflect the expected changes after each function call.

### Explanation of postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition states that the total supply of tokens is equal to the `supply` variable, which represents the total number of tokens created.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition states that after the transfer, the balance of `_to` has increased by `_value` and the balance of `msg.sender` has decreased by `_value`. This ensures that the tokens have been transferred correctly.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition states that after the transfer, the balance of `_to` has increased by `_value`, the balance of `_from` has decreased by `_value`, and the allowance for `msg.sender` to withdraw from `_from` has decreased by `_value`. This ensures that the transfer is consistent with the allowance.

4. **approve**: The postcondition states that the allowance for `_spender` is now equal to `_value`, which means that the spender has been granted permission to withdraw that amount from the owner's balance.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition states that the balance of `_owner` is equal to the `balance` variable, which reflects the current balance of tokens for that address.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition states that the allowance for `_spender` from `_owner` is equal to `remaining`, which indicates how much the spender is allowed to withdraw from the owner's balance.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is consistent with the ERC20 standard and that the state variables reflect the expected changes after each function call.

### Postcondition Explanations:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition `_totalSupply == supply` ensures that the total supply of tokens is consistent with the expected value after the function call.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that the recipient's balance has increased by the transferred value. The postcondition `_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by the same value.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that the recipient's balance has increased by the transferred value. The postcondition `_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by the same value. The postcondition `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the allowance has been decreased accordingly.

4. **approve**: The postcondition `_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value` ensures that the allowance for the spender has been set to the specified value.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition `_balances[_owner] == balance` ensures that the balance returned for the owner matches the expected balance in the mapping.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition `_allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining` ensures that the allowance returned for the spender matches the expected allowance in the mapping.

These postconditions reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 standard and ensure that the state of the contract is consistent after each function call.

### Postcondition Explanations:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition `_totalSupply == supply` ensures that the total supply of tokens matches the expected value after the function call.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that the recipient's balance has increased by `_value`. The postcondition `_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by the same value.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that the recipient's balance has increased by `_value`. The postcondition `_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by `_value`. The postcondition `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the allowance has been decreased accordingly.

4. **approve**: The postcondition `_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) + _value` ensures that the allowance for `_spender` has been increased by the specified `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition `_balances[_owner] == balance` ensures that the balance returned for the owner matches the expected balance in the mapping.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition `_allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining` ensures that the allowance returned for the spender matches the expected allowance in the mapping.

These postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 standard and ensure that the state of the contract is consistent after each function call.

=== USER [2025-03-30 13:46:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition `_totalSupply == supply` ensures that the total token supply matches the expected value after the function call.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that the recipient's balance has increased by `_value`, and `_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by the same amount.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that the recipient's balance has increased by `_value`. The postcondition `_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by `_value`, and `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the allowance for the sender has been decreased accordingly.

4. **approve**: The postcondition `_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) + _value` ensures that the allowance for `_spender` has been increased by the specified `_value`.

### Postcondition Annotations:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition `_totalSupply == supply` ensures that the total supply of tokens matches the expected value after the function call.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that the recipient's balance has increased by `_value`. The postcondition `_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by the same amount.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that the recipient's balance has increased by `_value`. The postcondition `_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by `_value`. The postcondition `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the allowance for the sender has been decreased accordingly.

4. **approve**: The postcondition `_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) + _value` ensures that the allowance for `_spender` has been increased by the specified `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition `_balances[_owner] == balance` ensures that the balance returned for the owner matches the expected balance in the mapping.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition `_allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining` ensures that the allowance returned for the spender matches the expected allowance in the mapping.

These postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 standard and ensure that the state of the contract is consistent after each function call.

### Postcondition Explanations:

1. **totalSupply**: The postcondition `_totalSupply == supply` ensures that the total supply of tokens is equal to the value returned by the function.

2. **transfer**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that after the transfer, the recipient's balance has increased by `_value`. The postcondition `_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by the same amount.

3. **transferFrom**: The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that after the transfer, the recipient's balance has increased by `_value`. The postcondition `_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value` ensures that the sender's balance has decreased by `_value`. The postcondition `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value` ensures that the allowance has been decreased accordingly.

4. **approve**: The postcondition `_allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) + _value` ensures that the allowance for `_spender` has been increased by the specified `_value`.

5. **balanceOf**: The postcondition `_balances[_owner] == balance` ensures that the balance returned for the owner matches the expected balance in the mapping.

6. **allowance**: The postcondition `_allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining` ensures that the allowance returned for the spender matches the expected allowance in the mapping.

These postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 standard and ensure that the state of the contract is consistent after each function call.
