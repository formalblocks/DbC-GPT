=== USER [2025-04-25 19:23:11] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: The length of the returned balances must match the length of the owners array, and the balance for each owner and token ID must match the stored balances.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status must be updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the caller and the specified operator.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: The returned approval status must reflect the current state in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: The balances must be updated correctly for both the sender and the recipient after the transfer, and the TransferSingle event must be emitted.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batches, ensuring that all balances are updated correctly and the TransferBatch event is emitted.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `balanceOf`**: The balance returned must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **Postconditions for `balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The length of the returned balances must match the length of the owners array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must match the corresponding value in `_balances` for the given `_owners` and `_ids`.
3. **Postconditions for `setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status must be updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the caller and the specified operator.
4. **Postconditions for `isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must reflect the current state in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The balances must be updated correctly for both the sender and recipient after the transfer.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted.
6. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batches, ensuring that all balances are updated correctly and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.
   - The correct syntax for emitting events is used, ensuring no parsing errors occur.

These annotations should now be compatible with the solc-verify tool without causing parsing errors.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:24:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-25 19:24:23] ===
Here’s the corrected version of the ERC1155 contract with appropriate postconditions added for each function, using the solc-verify syntax correctly. The issues causing errors in the previous annotations have been addressed, particularly regarding the syntax for emitting events and the usage of `forall`.

```solidity

    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `balanceOf`**: The balance returned must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **Postconditions for `balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The length of the returned balances must match the length of the owners array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must match the corresponding value in `_balances` for the given `_owners` and `_ids`.
3. **Postconditions for `setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status must be updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the caller and the specified operator.
4. **Postconditions for `isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must reflect the current state in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The balances must be updated correctly for both the sender and the recipient after the transfer.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted using the correct syntax.
6. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batches, ensuring that all balances are updated correctly and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted using the correct syntax.

These annotations should now be compatible with the solc-verify tool without causing parsing errors.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:24:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The balance returned must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` must match the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must match the corresponding value in `_balances` for the given `_owners` and `_ids`.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status must be updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the caller and the specified operator.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must reflect the current state in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The balances must be updated correctly for both the sender and the recipient after the transfer.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batches, ensuring that all balances are updated correctly and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

These annotations should now be compatible with the solc-verify tool without causing parsing errors. Please ensure to test the contract with the solc-verify tool to confirm that the annotations meet all requirements and expectations.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:25:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The balance returned must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` must match the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must match the corresponding value in `_balances` for the given `_owners` and `_ids`.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status must be updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the caller and the specified operator.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must reflect the current state in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The balances must be updated correctly for both the sender and the recipient after the transfer.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batches, ensuring that all balances are updated correctly and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

These annotations should now be compatible with the solc-verify tool without causing parsing errors. Please ensure to test the contract with the solc-verify tool to confirm that the annotations meet all requirements and expectations.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:26:30] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Summary of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The length of `batchBalances` must equal the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance for each owner and token ID in `_balances`.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the current approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balances must reflect the transfer: the sender's balance decreases, and the recipient's balance increases by the transferred value.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applies to multiple token IDs and values.
   - The `TransferBatch` event must be emitted.

These annotations should work well with the solc-verify tool. Please ensure to test the contract with the tool to confirm that the annotations meet all requirements and expectations.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:27:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Summary of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance for each owner and token ID in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - The approval status must be updated correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the caller and the specified operator.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - The returned approval status must reflect the current state in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The balances must be updated correctly for both the sender and the recipient after the transfer.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applies to multiple token IDs and values.
   - The `TransferBatch` event must be emitted.

These annotations should now be compatible with the solc-verify tool. Please ensure to test the contract with the tool to confirm that the annotations meet all requirements and expectations.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:28:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance for each owner and token ID in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - The approval status must be updated correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the caller and the specified operator.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - The returned approval status must reflect the current state in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The balances must be updated correctly for both the sender and the recipient after the transfer.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applies to multiple token IDs and values.
   - The `TransferBatch` event must be emitted.

These annotations should now be compatible with the solc-verify tool. Please ensure to test the contract with the tool to confirm that the annotations meet all requirements and expectations.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:29:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Summary of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance for each owner and token ID in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - The approval status must be updated correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the caller and the specified operator.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - The returned approval status must reflect the current state in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The balances must be updated correctly for both the sender and the recipient after the transfer.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applies to multiple token IDs and values.
   - The `TransferBatch` event must be emitted.

These annotations should now be compatible with the solc-verify tool. Please ensure to test the contract with the tool to confirm that the annotations meet all requirements and expectations.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:30:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Summary of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance for each owner and token ID in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - The approval status must be updated correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the caller and the specified operator.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - The returned approval status must reflect the current state in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The balances must be updated correctly for both the sender and the recipient after the transfer.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but applies to multiple token IDs and values.
   - The `TransferBatch` event must be emitted.

These annotations should now be compatible with the solc-verify tool. Please ensure to test the contract with the tool to confirm that the annotations meet all requirements and expectations.
