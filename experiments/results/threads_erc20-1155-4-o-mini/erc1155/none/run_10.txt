=== USER [2025-04-25 19:40:08] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures that the length of the returned array matches the length of the owners array and that each returned balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.
- **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures that the balance of the sender decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly, while also checking that the transfer event is emitted.
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for multiple tokens and ensures that the balances are updated correctly for each token ID and that the batch transfer event is emitted.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Postcondition Syntax**: 
   - Changed `==>` to `==>` for implications in `forall` expressions.
   - Added `emit` prefix to event emissions in postconditions to comply with the expected syntax.

2. **Postconditions**:
   - Each function has been annotated with postconditions that accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard. The conditions ensure that the state variables are modified correctly and that events are emitted as expected.

This should resolve the errors you encountered and provide a clear formal specification for the contract's functions.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:41:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures that the length of the returned array matches the length of the owners array and that each returned balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures that the balance of the sender decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly. It also checks that the transfer event is emitted with the correct parameters.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for multiple tokens and ensures that the balances are updated correctly for each token ID and that the batch transfer event is emitted.

This version should resolve the errors you encountered and provide a clear formal specification for the contract's functions according to the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:42:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures that the length of the returned array matches the length of the owners array and that each returned balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures that the balance of the sender decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly. It also checks that the transfer event is emitted with the correct parameters.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for multiple tokens and ensures that the balances are updated correctly for each token ID and that the batch transfer event is emitted.

This version should resolve the errors you encountered and provide a clear formal specification for the contract's functions according to the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:42:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: 
     - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the length of `_owners`.
     - Ensures that for each index `i`, the balance returned in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the approval status for the specified operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: 
     - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.
     - Ensures that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: 
     - Ensures that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts in `_values`.
     - Ensures that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

This annotated contract should now reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard and should not produce parsing errors during verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:43:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: 
     - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the length of `_owners`.
     - Ensures that for each index `i`, the balance returned in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the approval status for the specified operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: 
     - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.
     - Ensures that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: 
     - Ensures that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts in `_values`.
     - Ensures that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

This annotated contract should now reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard and should not produce parsing errors during verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:44:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: 
     - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the length of `_owners`.
     - Ensures that for each index `i`, the balance returned in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the approval status for the specified operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: 
     - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.
     - Ensures that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - **Postcondition**: 
     - Ensures that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts in `_values`.
     - Ensures that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

This annotated contract should now reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard and should not produce parsing errors during verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:45:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned balance is equal to the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the length of `_owners`.
     - Ensures that for each index `i`, the balance returned in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the approval status for the specified operator is updated correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.
     - Ensures that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts in `_values`.
     - Ensures that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

This annotated contract should now accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard and should not produce parsing errors during verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:46:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Let's annotate the `ERC1155` smart contract with appropriate postconditions for each function. The postconditions will be designed to ensure that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC-1155 standard. Below is the contract with the necessary annotations:

```solidity

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the length of `_owners`.
     - Ensures that for each index `i`, the balance returned in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the approval status for the specified operator is updated correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.
     - Ensures that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts in `_values`.
     - Ensures that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

This annotated contract should now accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard and should not produce parsing errors during verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:47:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that the length of `batchBalances` matches the length of `_owners`.
     - Ensures that for each index `i`, the balance returned in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the approval status for the specified operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored value in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases accordingly.
     - Ensures that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - **Postcondition**:
     - Ensures that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts in `_values`.
     - Ensures that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct parameters.

This annotated contract should now accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC-1155 standard and should not produce parsing errors during verification. If you have any further questions or need additional modifications, feel free to ask!
