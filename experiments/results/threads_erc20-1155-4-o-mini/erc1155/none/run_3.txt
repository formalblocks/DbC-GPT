    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
- For `balanceOf`, it checks that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in `_balances`.
- For `balanceOfBatch`, it ensures that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.
- For `setApprovalForAll`, it ensures that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly.
- For `isApprovedForAll`, it verifies that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping.
- For `safeTransferFrom`, it ensures the balances are updated correctly after the transfer and that the transfer event is emitted.
- For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, it verifies that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the transfer event is emitted for the batch.

This formal specification ensures that the behavior of the contract adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and can be verified for correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-25 18:43:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-25 18:43:03] ===
Based on the provided ERC1155 contract and the requirements for formal verification conditions, I will add appropriate postconditions using the solc-verify syntax. The errors you encountered are likely due to syntax issues in the annotations. I will ensure the annotations are correctly formatted and that they follow the guidelines provided.

Here’s the annotated contract with the correct postconditions:

```solidity

    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

### Key Changes and Fixes:
1. **Postcondition Syntax**: 
   - Changed the event emission annotations to use `emit` keyword correctly.
   - Ensured that the `forall` syntax is correctly formatted.

2. **Postconditions**:
   - For `balanceOf`, the postcondition checks that the returned balance matches the stored balance.
   - For `balanceOfBatch`, it checks that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.
   - For `setApprovalForAll`, it ensures that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly.
   - For `isApprovedForAll`, it verifies that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping.
   - For `safeTransferFrom`, it ensures the balances are updated correctly after the transfer and that the transfer event is emitted.
   - For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, it verifies that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the transfer event is emitted for the batch.

This should resolve the errors and warnings you encountered when compiling the contract. Make sure to review and test thoroughly in your development environment.

=== USER [2025-04-25 18:43:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance in `_balances`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: It checks that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The postcondition ensures that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: This verifies that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The postconditions confirm that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer and that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: It verifies that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted for the batch.

This should resolve the previous errors you encountered. Make sure to test the contract in your development environment to verify its correctness.

=== USER [2025-04-25 18:44:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Summary of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures that the returned array of balances has the same length as the input array of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to the respective token ID and owner.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Verifies that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer and that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Confirms that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

This should satisfy the requirements and resolve the errors you encountered during compilation. Make sure to test the contract thoroughly in your development environment.

=== USER [2025-04-25 18:45:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-25 18:45:10] ===
To address the task of adding formal verification conditions to the ERC1155 smart contract, I'll provide the required postconditions for each function using the solc-verify syntax. The goal is to ensure that the postconditions accurately represent the expected behavior of the contract according to the ERC-1155 standard.

Here’s the annotated contract with the appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The postcondition checks that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The postcondition ensures that the returned array of balances has the same length as the input array of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to the respective token ID and owner.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The postcondition verifies that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly in `_operatorApprovals` and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The postcondition checks that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The postconditions confirm that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer and that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: The postconditions ensure that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

### Error Handling
Make sure to test the contract thoroughly in your development environment to ensure that the postconditions are correctly implemented and that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC-1155 standard. If you encounter any specific errors during compilation, please provide those details for further assistance.

=== USER [2025-04-25 18:45:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with formal verification conditions, I will provide appropriate postconditions for each function using the specified solc-verify syntax. The goal is to ensure that these postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the contract in accordance with the ERC-1155 standard.

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - The postcondition checks that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned array of balances has the same length as the input array of owners and that each balance corresponds to the respective token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - The postcondition verifies that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly in `_operatorApprovals` and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - The postcondition checks that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The postconditions confirm that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer and that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - The postconditions ensure that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

### Error Handling
Make sure to test the contract thoroughly in your development environment to ensure that the postconditions are correctly implemented and that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC-1155 standard. If you encounter any specific errors during compilation, please provide those details for further assistance.

=== USER [2025-04-25 18:46:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To provide the required formal verification conditions for the ERC1155 smart contract, I will add appropriate postconditions for each function. These postconditions will follow the solc-verify syntax and accurately reflect the expected behavior as defined by the ERC-1155 standard.

Here’s the annotated contract with the necessary postconditions:

}
```

### Summary of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly in `_operatorApprovals` and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Verifies that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Confirms that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer and that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

### Error Handling
Make sure to test the contract thoroughly in your development environment to ensure that the postconditions are correctly implemented and that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC-1155 standard. If you encounter any specific errors during compilation, please provide those details for further assistance.

=== USER [2025-04-25 18:47:30] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

=== ASSISTANT [2025-04-25 18:47:34] ===
To provide the required formal verification conditions for the ERC1155 smart contract, I will add appropriate postconditions for each function using the specified solc-verify syntax. The goal is to ensure that these postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior as defined by the ERC-1155 standard.

Here’s the annotated contract with the necessary postconditions:

}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned balance of the specified token ID for the owner matches the value stored in `_balances`.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The postcondition verifies that the returned array of balances has the same length as the input array of owners and that each balance corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - The postcondition checks that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly in `_operatorApprovals` and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - The postcondition confirms that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The postconditions confirm that the balances of the sender and receiver are updated correctly after the transfer, and that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - The postconditions ensure that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

### Error Handling
Make sure to test the contract thoroughly in your development environment to ensure that the postconditions are correctly implemented and that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC-1155 standard. If you encounter any specific errors during compilation, please provide those details for further assistance.

=== USER [2025-04-25 18:48:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures that the returned array of balances has the same length as the input array of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to the respective token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly in `_operatorApprovals` and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Verifies that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Confirms that the balances of the sender and receiver are updated correctly after the transfer, and that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

### Error Handling
Make sure to test the contract thoroughly in your development environment to ensure that the postconditions are correctly implemented and that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC-1155 standard. If you encounter any specific errors during compilation, please provide those details for further assistance.

=== USER [2025-04-25 18:49:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with formal verification conditions, I will add appropriate postconditions for each function. These postconditions will follow the solc-verify syntax and accurately reflect the expected behavior as defined by the ERC-1155 standard.

Here’s the complete contract with the necessary postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the provided token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - The postcondition checks that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to the respective token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - The postcondition verifies that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly in `_operatorApprovals` and that the `ApprovalForAll` event is emitted.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - The postcondition confirms that the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The postconditions confirm that the balances of the sender and receiver are updated correctly after the transfer and that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - The postconditions ensure that all balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

### Error Handling
Make sure to test the contract thoroughly in your development environment to ensure that the postconditions are correctly implemented and that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC-1155 standard. If you encounter any specific errors during compilation, please provide those details for further assistance.
