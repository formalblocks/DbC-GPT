=== USER [2025-04-25 19:31:13] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The balance returned should match the balance stored in `_balances` mapping for the given token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned balances array should match the length of the owners array. Each balance should correspond to the respective owner's balance for the given token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: After setting approval, the approval status in `_operatorApprovals` should reflect the new value.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned value should accurately reflect the approval status stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The function must ensure that the `_to` address is not zero, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. The event `TransferSingle` must be emitted with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but it checks that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal, and it processes multiple transfers. The balances are updated accordingly, and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted with the correct parameters. 

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the balance recorded in the mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the `batchBalances` array must equal the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function (approved or revoked).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Verifies that each sender's balance decreases as expected and that each recipient's balance increases accordingly.
   - Emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct parameters.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:32:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the `batchBalances` array must equal the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function (approved or revoked).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Verifies that each sender's balance decreases as expected and that each recipient's balance increases accordingly.
   - Emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct parameters.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:33:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The balance returned must match the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must equal the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function (approved or revoked).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Verifies that each sender's balance decreases as expected and that each recipient's balance increases accordingly.
   - Emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct parameters.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:34:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The balance returned must match the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must equal the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function (approved or revoked).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Verifies that each sender's balance decreases as expected and that each recipient's balance increases accordingly.
   - Emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct parameters.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:35:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The balance returned must match the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must equal the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function (approved or revoked).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Verifies that each sender's balance decreases as expected and that each recipient's balance increases accordingly.
   - Emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct parameters.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:35:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The returned balance must match the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must equal the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function (approved or revoked).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The returned approval status must match the stored approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount, and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Verifies that each sender's balance decreases as expected and that each recipient's balance increases accordingly.
   - Emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct parameters.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:36:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The balance returned must match the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must equal the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function (approved or revoked).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The returned approval status must match the stored approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount, and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Verifies that each sender's balance decreases as expected and that each recipient's balance increases accordingly.
   - Emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct parameters.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:37:48] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The balance returned must match the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must equal the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function (approved or revoked).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The returned approval status must match the stored approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount, and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Verifies that each sender's balance decreases as expected and that each recipient's balance increases accordingly.
   - Emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct parameters.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-04-25 19:39:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The returned balance must match the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must equal the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must reflect the value passed to the function (approved or revoked).

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The returned approval status must match the stored approval status in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - Checks that the `_to` address is not the zero address.
   - Ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount, and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - Emits the `TransferSingle` event with the correct parameters.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Ensures that the `_to` address is not the zero address and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Verifies that each sender's balance decreases as expected and that each recipient's balance increases accordingly.
   - Emits the `TransferBatch` event with the correct parameters.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.
