    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;

    /**

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - Added a postcondition to ensure that the sender's balance is sufficient to cover the transfer amount.
   - Specified that the transfer can be zero, and the recipient cannot be the zero address.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Similar to the transfer function, added a postcondition to check that the sender has enough tokens to transfer.
   - Included a condition for self-transfers and ensured that the function handles zero-value transfers correctly.

These changes should help the verifier understand the expected behavior of the functions and ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of each function.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - The postcondition now explicitly states that the sender's balance must be sufficient to cover the transfer amount, while also allowing for zero-value transfers.
   - It ensures that the recipient address is valid (not the zero address).

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - The postcondition checks that the sender has enough tokens to transfer, while also allowing for zero-value transfers.
   - It confirms that both the sender and recipient addresses are valid.

These adjustments should address the errors reported by the verifier, ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Total Supply**:
   - The postcondition states that the returned supply is equal to the total supply stored in the contract.

2. **Transfer Function**:
   - The postcondition checks that if the transfer is successful, the sender's balance is reduced by the amount transferred. If it is not successful, the balance remains unchanged.
   - It ensures that the sender has enough tokens to cover the transfer amount unless the transfer amount is zero.
   - It confirms that the recipient address is valid (not the zero address).

3. **Transfer From Function**:
   - Similar to the transfer function, it checks that the sender's balance is sufficient for the transfer amount.
   - It ensures that both the sender and recipient addresses are valid.

4. **Approve Function**:
   - The postcondition states that the allowance set for the spender is correctly updated.
   - It also ensures that the spender address is valid unless the allowance is zero.

5. **Balance Of Function**:
   - The postcondition confirms that the returned balance matches the balance stored in the contract for the specified owner.

6. **Allowance Function**:
   - The postcondition states that the returned remaining allowance matches the allowance set for the spender by the owner.

These annotations should help the verifier understand the expected behavior of the functions and ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of each function, addressing the errors reported by the verifier.

=== USER [2025-04-25 17:25:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Total Supply**:
   - The postcondition confirms that the total supply returned by the function matches the internal state variable `_totalSupply`.

2. **Transfer Function**:
   - The postcondition checks that if the transfer is successful, the sender's balance is reduced by the amount transferred. If it is not successful, the balance remains unchanged.
   - It ensures that the sender has enough tokens to cover the transfer amount unless the transfer amount is zero.
   - It confirms that the recipient address is valid (not the zero address).

3. **Transfer From Function**:
   - Similar to the transfer function, it checks that the sender has enough tokens to transfer, while also allowing for zero-value transfers.
   - It ensures that both the sender and recipient addresses are valid.

4. **Approve Function**:
   - The postcondition states that the allowance set for the spender is correctly updated.
   - It also ensures that the spender address is valid unless the allowance is zero.

5. **Balance Of Function**:
   - The postcondition confirms that the returned balance matches the balance stored in the contract for the specified owner.

6. **Allowance Function**:
   - The postcondition states that the returned remaining allowance matches the allowance set for the spender by the owner.

These annotations should help the verifier understand the expected behavior of the functions and ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of each function, addressing the errors reported by the verifier.
