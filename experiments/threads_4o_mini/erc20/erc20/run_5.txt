=== USER [2025-03-12 12:07:58] ===

    Given an example of ERC interface, the ERC interface to be annotated and an EIP markdown, generate a specification for the ERC interface with solc-verify postconditions annotations, just postconditions, no other annotations types, this is very important!

    Instructions:

    - Function Bodies: The specification must not contain function implementations.
    - Postconditions Limit: Each function must have at most 4 postcondition (/// @notice postcondition) annotations above the function signature. Do not exceed this limit under any circumstances.
    - Position: add the solc-verify annotation above the related function, example:
        /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
        function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);
    - Output format: return the annotated interface inside code fence (```) to show the code block. RETURN JUST THE CONTRACT ANNOTATED, NOTHING MORE.

    Guidance for Generating Postconditions:

    - State Changes: Reflect how state variables change. For example, ownership transfer should reflect changes in token ownership and balances.
    - Conditions on Input: Consider how inputs affect the state variables.
    - Reset Conditions: Ensure certain variables are reset after the function execution, if applicable.
    

ERC interface example:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.5.7;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint _value);
    event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint _value);

    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _balances[msg.sender] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_balances[msg.sender] ) - _value  && msg.sender  != _to ) ||   ( _balances[msg.sender] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _balances[msg.sender]) && msg.sender  == _to ) &&  success )   || !success
    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _balances[_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _balances[_to] ) + _value  && msg.sender  != _to ) ||   ( _balances[_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _balances[_to] ) && msg.sender  == _to )  )   || !success
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _balances[_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_balances[_from] ) - _value  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _balances[_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _balances[_from] ) &&  _from == _to ) && success ) || !success 
    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _balances[_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _balances[_to] ) + _value  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _balances[_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _balances[_to] ) &&  _from  == _to ) && success ) || !success 
    /// @notice  postcondition ( _allowed[_from ][msg.sender] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_allowed[_from ][msg.sender] ) - _value && success) || ( _allowed[_from ][msg.sender] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_allowed[_from ][msg.sender]) && !success) ||  _from  == msg.sender
    /// @notice  postcondition  _allowed[_from ][msg.sender]  <= __verifier_old_uint (_allowed[_from ][msg.sender] ) ||  _from  == msg.sender
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /// @notice  postcondition (_allowed[msg.sender ][ _spender] ==  _value  &&  success) || ( _allowed[msg.sender ][ _spender] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _allowed[msg.sender ][ _spender] ) && !success )    
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_owner][_spender] == remaining
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}

    Can you please generate a specification given the following ERC interface (delimited by token ```solidity ```) and EIP markdown (delimited by token <eip>)?
              
    HERE FOLLOWS THE CONTRACT TO ADD SOLC-VERIFY ANNOTATIONS, LIKE THE EXAMPLES ABOVE:

    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```
