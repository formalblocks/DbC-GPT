=== USER [2025-03-14 18:50:45] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
- **`balanceOf`**: Ensures the returned balance matches the stored balance for the given token and owner.
- **`balanceOfBatch`**: Ensures the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.
- **`setApprovalForAll`**: Ensures that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
- **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures the returned approval status matches the stored approval mapping.
- **`safeTransferFrom`**: Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer and that the appropriate event is emitted.
- **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Ensures that multiple balances are updated correctly after the batch transfer and that the appropriate event is emitted, maintaining the order of operations. 

These postconditions provide a formal verification of the expected behavior of the contract functions according to the ERC-1155 standard.

To resolve the issues with the solc-verify annotations in the ERC1155 contract, we need to ensure that the syntax is correct and that the postconditions are formulated according to the requirements of the solc-verify tool. Below are the corrected postconditions that adhere to the specified guidelines, including proper syntax for `forall` and event emission:

### Corrections Made:
1. **Postconditions Syntax**: 
   - Changed `forall(uint256 i in 0..n)` to `forall(uint256 i) { i < n ==> condition }` to fit the expected syntax.
   
2. **Event Emission**: 
   - Prefixed event emissions with `emit` to comply with the expected syntax for emitting events.

3. **Consistency**: 
   - Ensured that all postconditions are consistent with the contract's behavior and the ERC-1155 standard.

These changes should resolve the errors and warnings you encountered while compiling and ensure that the contract meets the formal verification requirements.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:52:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

### Corrections Made:
1. **Postconditions Syntax**:
   - The syntax for `forall(uint256 i)` was corrected to `forall(uint256 i) { i < n ==> condition }` to ensure it meets the requirements of the solc-verify tool.

2. **Event Emission**:
   - Prefixed event emissions with `emit` to comply with the expected syntax for emitting events.

3. **Consistency**:
   - Ensured that all postconditions are consistent with the contract's behavior and the ERC-1155 standard.

These changes should help resolve the errors and warnings you encountered while compiling and ensure that the contract meets the formal verification requirements.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:52:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of the Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The balance returned must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given token ID and owner address.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the correct token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must match the value set in the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balance of the sender must decrease by the amount transferred.
   - The balance of the recipient must increase by the amount transferred.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted correctly.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - For each token ID in `_ids`, the balance of the sender must decrease by the corresponding value in `_values`.
   - For each token ID in `_ids`, the balance of the recipient must increase by the corresponding value in `_values`.
   - The `TransferBatch` event must be emitted correctly.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the syntax for `forall` is properly used, as it needs to fit the expected format for solc-verify.
- The postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is verifiable and consistent with the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:53:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-14 18:53:24] ===
To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with solc-verify postconditions, we need to ensure that the syntax is correct and that each postcondition accurately reflects the expected behavior of the functions according to the ERC-1155 standard. Below is the annotated contract with the necessary postconditions:

```solidity

    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the correct token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must match the value set in the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The returned approval status must match the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balance of the sender must decrease by the amount transferred.
   - The balance of the recipient must increase by the amount transferred.
   - The `TransferSingle` event must be emitted correctly.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - For each token ID in `_ids`, the balance of the sender must decrease by the corresponding value in `_values`.
   - For each token ID in `_ids`, the balance of the recipient must increase by the corresponding value in `_values`.
   - The `TransferBatch` event must be emitted correctly.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the syntax for `forall` is properly used, as it needs to fit the expected format for solc-verify.
- The postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is verifiable and consistent with the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:54:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of the Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner address.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The postcondition checks that the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - It also ensures that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The postcondition verifies that the approval status for the operator matches the value provided in the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned approval status matches the value stored in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The postconditions ensure that the sender's balance decreases by the amount transferred and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - It also checks that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - The postconditions ensure that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases by the corresponding value in `_values`, and the recipient's balance increases by that same value.
   - It also checks that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted correctly.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the syntax for `forall` is properly used, as it needs to fit the expected format for solc-verify.
- The postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is verifiable and consistent with the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:55:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with solc-verify postconditions, we need to ensure that the syntax is correct and that each postcondition accurately reflects the expected behavior of the functions according to the ERC-1155 standard. Below is the annotated contract with the necessary postconditions:

### Explanation of the Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The postcondition checks that the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the correct token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The postcondition verifies that the approval status for the operator matches the value provided in the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned approval status matches the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The postconditions ensure that the sender's balance decreases by the amount transferred and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - It also checks that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - The postconditions ensure that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases by the corresponding value in `_values`, and the recipient's balance increases by that same value.
   - It also checks that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted correctly.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the syntax for `forall` is properly used, as it needs to fit the expected format for solc-verify.
- The postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is verifiable and consistent with the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:56:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The postcondition checks that the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the correct token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The postcondition verifies that the approval status for the operator matches the value provided in the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned approval status matches the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The postconditions ensure that the sender's balance decreases by the amount transferred and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - It also checks that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - The postconditions ensure that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases by the corresponding value in `_values`, and the recipient's balance increases by that same value.
   - It also checks that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted correctly.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the syntax for `forall` is properly used, as it needs to fit the expected format for solc-verify.
- The postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is verifiable and consistent with the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:57:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with solc-verify postconditions, we need to ensure that we use the correct syntax and that each postcondition accurately reflects the expected behavior of the functions according to the ERC-1155 standard.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The postcondition checks that the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the correct token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The postcondition verifies that the approval status for the operator matches the value provided in the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned approval status matches the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The postconditions ensure that the sender's balance decreases by the amount transferred and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount.
   - It also checks that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - The postconditions ensure that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases by the corresponding value in `_values`, and the recipient's balance increases by that same value.
   - It also checks that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted correctly.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the syntax for `forall` is properly used, as it needs to fit the expected format for solc-verify.
- The postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is verifiable and consistent with the ERC-1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:58:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

### Explanation of the Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - **Postcondition**: `balance == _balances[_id][_owner]`
     - This ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - **Postcondition**: `batchBalances.length == _owners.length`
     - This checks that the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - **Postcondition**: `forall(uint256 i) { i < _owners.length ==> batchBalances[i] == _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]] }`
     - This ensures that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the correct token ID and owner.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - **Postcondition**: `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved`
     - This verifies that the approval status for the operator matches the value provided in the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - **Postcondition**: `approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`
     - This ensures that the returned approval status matches the value stored in `_operatorApprovals`.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - **Postcondition**: `_balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value`
     - This ensures that the sender's balance decreases by the amount transferred.
   - **Postcondition**: `_balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value`
     - This ensures that the recipient's balance increases by the amount transferred.
   - **Postcondition**: `emit TransferSingle(msg.sender, _from, _to, _id, _value);`
     - This checks that the `TransferSingle` event is emitted correctly.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - **Postcondition**: `forall(uint256 i) { i < _ids.length ==> _balances[_ids[i]][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i] }`
     - This ensures that for each token ID in `_ids`, the sender's balance decreases by the corresponding value in `_values`.
   - **Postcondition**: `forall(uint256 i) { i < _ids.length ==> _balances[_ids[i]][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i] }`
     - This ensures that for each token ID in `_ids`, the recipient's balance increases by the corresponding value in `_values`.
   - **Postcondition**: `emit TransferBatch(msg.sender, _from, _to, _ids, _values);`
     - This checks that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted correctly.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the syntax for `forall` is correctly used, as it needs to fit the expected format for solc-verify.
- The postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is verifiable and consistent with the ERC-1155 standard.
