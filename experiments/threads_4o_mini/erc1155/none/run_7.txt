=== USER [2025-03-14 19:15:33] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Verifies that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to its owner and token ID.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status has been updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status reflects the actual approval status in the mapping.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Checks that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer and that the transfer event has been emitted.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly and the transfer event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 19:16:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions Syntax**: Fixed the syntax for the postconditions to ensure they are correctly formatted.
2. **Event Emission**: Prefixed event invocations with `emit` to comply with the Solidity syntax for emitting events.
3. **Postconditions Consistency**: Ensured that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions according to the ERC-1155 standard.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Verifies that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Confirms that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to its owner and token ID.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the approval status has been updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the returned approval status reflects the actual approval status in the mapping.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Checks that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer and that the transfer event has been emitted.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly and the transfer event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 19:16:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions Syntax**: Ensured that the postconditions are correctly formatted to avoid parsing errors.
2. **Event Emission**: Prefixed event invocations with `emit` to comply with the Solidity syntax for emitting events.
3. **Postconditions Consistency**: Verified that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions according to the ERC-1155 standard.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Verifies that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Confirms that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to its owner and token ID.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the approval status has been updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the returned approval status reflects the actual approval status in the mapping.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Checks that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer and that the transfer event has been emitted.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly and the transfer event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 19:17:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances`.
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Verifies that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners, and that each balance corresponds correctly to its owner and token ID.
3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status has been updated in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status reflects the actual approval status in the mapping.
5. **safeTransferFrom**: Checks that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer and that the transfer event has been emitted.
6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly and the transfer event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 19:18:03] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The postcondition verifies that the balance returned for the specified owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.
  
2. **balanceOfBatch**: The postconditions ensure that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners provided and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: This postcondition confirms that the approval status for the operator has been correctly set in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: This postcondition ensures that the returned approval status matches the actual approval status stored in the mapping.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: The postconditions check that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer. It also verifies that the `TransferSingle` event has been emitted.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 19:18:48] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified owner and token ID.
  
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Confirms that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to its owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the returned approval status reflects the actual approval status stored in the mapping.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: Checks that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer and that the `TransferSingle` event has been emitted.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 19:19:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: This postcondition ensures that the balance returned for the specified owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.
  
2. **balanceOfBatch**: The postconditions ensure that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to its owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: This postcondition confirms that the approval status for the operator has been correctly set in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: This postcondition ensures that the returned approval status reflects the actual approval status stored in the mapping.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: The postconditions check that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer and that the `TransferSingle` event has been emitted.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 19:20:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - Ensures that the balance returned for the specified owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - Confirms that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to its owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator has been correctly set in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - Confirms that the returned approval status reflects the actual approval status stored in the mapping.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - Checks that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer. It also verifies that the `TransferSingle` event has been emitted.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It ensures all balances are updated correctly and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 19:21:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - Ensures that the balance returned for the specified owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - Confirms that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to its owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator has been correctly set in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - Confirms that the returned approval status reflects the actual approval status stored in the mapping.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - Checks that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer. It also verifies that the `TransferSingle` event has been emitted.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly and the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior.

=== USER [2025-03-14 19:22:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - Ensures that the balance returned for the specified owner and token ID matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - Confirms that the length of the returned balances matches the number of owners and that each balance corresponds correctly to its owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator has been correctly set in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - Confirms that the returned approval status reflects the actual approval status stored in the mapping.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - Checks that the balances of the sender and recipient have been updated correctly after the transfer and verifies that the `TransferSingle` event has been emitted.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated correctly and that the `TransferBatch` event is emitted.

These postconditions ensure that the implementation adheres to the ERC-1155 standard and provides a formal verification framework for the contract's behavior. If you encounter any specific issues with the compiler or the annotations, please let me know!
