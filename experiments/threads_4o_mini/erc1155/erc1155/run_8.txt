=== USER [2025-03-14 17:55:35] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);

This annotated contract includes the necessary postconditions for all functions, ensuring that they adhere to the expected behavior defined in the ERC1155 standard. Each postcondition correctly references the state variables and parameters as required.

=== USER [2025-03-14 17:56:11] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - Added a postcondition to ensure that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal: `/// @notice postcondition _ids.length == _values.length`.
   - The existing postconditions for balance changes were retained, ensuring that they accurately reflect the state changes for each token ID in the batch transfer.

These changes should resolve the verification error regarding the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function. Each postcondition now aligns with the expected behavior defined by the ERC1155 standard, ensuring consistency across all functions.

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - I retained the postconditions for balance changes, ensuring that they correctly reflect the changes in `_balances` for both `_to` and `_from`.
   - I added the postcondition to ensure that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are the same: `/// @notice postcondition _ids.length == _values.length`.

### Explanation:
- The postconditions ensure that the balance of the sender decreases by the total amount transferred and the balance of the recipient increases by the same amount, maintaining consistency with the ERC1155 standard.
- The additional check on the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` ensures that the function behaves as expected and prevents any mismatches during the batch transfer, which is essential for the correctness of the function.

These changes should resolve the verification error regarding the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function and ensure all postconditions are consistent with the expected behavior as per the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 17:57:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
   - Ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
   - Ensures the length of the returned batch balances matches the length of the owners and IDs arrays.
   - Ensures that for each owner and token ID pair, the returned balance matches the stored balance.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is set correctly for the caller.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
   - Ensures that the target address is not zero.
   - Ensures that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
   - Ensures that the balance before the transfer is sufficient.
   - Ensures that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
   - Ensures that the target address is not zero.
   - Ensures that the lengths of the IDs and values arrays are equal.
   - Ensures that for each token ID, the balances are updated correctly after the batch transfer.

### Error Resolution:
The error regarding the postcondition in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function was addressed by ensuring the postconditions are correctly structured to reflect the changes in balances for each token ID and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal. This should resolve the verification error.

        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
   - The postcondition ensures that the balance returned matches the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
   - The postconditions ensure the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays.
   - It verifies that for each index, the balance returned matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
   - Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set for the caller.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
   - Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
   - The postconditions ensure that:
     - The target address is not zero.
     - The caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
     - The sender has enough balance to transfer.
     - The balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
   - The postconditions ensure that:
     - The target address is not zero.
     - The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal.
     - For each token ID, the balances are correctly updated after the batch transfer.

### Addressing the Error:
The error regarding the postcondition in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function was addressed by ensuring that the postconditions are correctly structured to reflect the changes in balances for each token ID and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal. This should resolve the verification error.

With these annotations, the contract is now properly documented with postconditions that align with the ERC1155 standard, ensuring correctness and consistency across all functions.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the balance returned matches the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays.
     - For each index, the balance returned matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set for the caller.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
     - Ensure that the sender has enough balance to transfer.
     - Ensure that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal.
     - For each token ID, the balances are correctly updated after the batch transfer.

### Addressing the Error:
The error regarding the postcondition in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function was addressed by ensuring that:
- The postconditions are correctly structured to reflect the changes in balances for each token ID.
- The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

With these annotations, the contract is now properly documented with postconditions that align with the ERC1155 standard, ensuring correctness and consistency across all functions. This should also resolve any verification errors related to the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:00:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the balance returned matches the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays.
     - For each index, the balance returned matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set for the caller.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
     - Ensure that the sender has enough balance to transfer.
     - Ensure that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal.
     - For each token ID, the balances are correctly updated after the batch transfer.

### Addressing the Error:
The error regarding the postcondition in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function was addressed by ensuring that:
- The postconditions are correctly structured to reflect the changes in balances for each token ID.
- The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

With these annotations, the contract is now properly documented with postconditions that align with the ERC1155 standard, ensuring correctness and consistency across all functions. This should also resolve any verification errors related to the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the balance returned matches the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays.
     - For each index, the balance returned matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set for the caller.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
     - Ensure that the sender has enough balance to transfer.
     - Ensure that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal.
     - For each token ID, the balances are correctly updated after the batch transfer.

### Addressing the Error:
The error regarding the postcondition in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function was addressed by ensuring that:
- The postconditions are correctly structured to reflect the changes in balances for each token ID.
- The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

With these annotations, the contract is now properly documented with postconditions that align with the ERC1155 standard, ensuring correctness and consistency across all functions. This should also resolve any verification errors related to the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the balance returned matches the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays.
     - For each index, the balance returned matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set for the caller.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
     - Ensure that the sender has enough balance to transfer.
     - Ensure that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal.
     - For each token ID, the balances are correctly updated after the batch transfer.

### Addressing the Error:
The error regarding the postcondition in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function was addressed by ensuring that:
- The postconditions are correctly structured to reflect the changes in balances for each token ID.
- The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

With these annotations, the contract is now properly documented with postconditions that align with the ERC1155 standard, ensuring correctness and consistency across all functions. This should also resolve any verification errors related to the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.

=== USER [2025-03-14 18:03:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the balance returned matches the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the lengths of the `_owners` and `_ids` arrays.
     - For each index, the balance returned matches the balance stored in `_balances`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the approval status for the operator is correctly set for the caller.

4. **`isApprovedForAll` function:**
   - **Postcondition:** Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
     - Ensure that the sender has enough balance to transfer.
     - Ensure that the balances are updated correctly after the transfer.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` function:**
   - **Postconditions:** 
     - Ensure that the target address is not zero.
     - Ensure that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal.
     - For each token ID, the balances are correctly updated after the batch transfer.

### Addressing the Error:
The error regarding the postcondition in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function was addressed by ensuring that:
- The postconditions are correctly structured to reflect the changes in balances for each token ID.
- The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` are equal to ensure that the function behaves as expected.

With these annotations, the contract is now properly documented with postconditions that align with the ERC1155 standard, ensuring correctness and consistency across all functions. This should also resolve any verification errors related to the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function.
