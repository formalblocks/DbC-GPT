=== USER [2025-03-15 00:27:47] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance should equal the stored balance for the given owner and token ID.
   
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array must match the length of the input owners array, and each balance in the array must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balance of the sender should decrease by the amount transferred, and the recipient's balance should increase accordingly. The recipient must not be the zero address.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to the single transfer, but for each token in the batch, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases. The recipient must not be the zero address, and the lengths of the IDs and values arrays must match. 

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned balances array must match the length of the owners array, and each balance must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balance of the sender should decrease by the amount transferred, and the recipient's balance should increase accordingly. The recipient must not be the zero address, and self-transfers are handled appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to the single transfer, but for each token in the batch, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases. The recipient must not be the zero address, the lengths of the IDs and values arrays must match, and self-transfers are handled as well.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:28:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array of balances must match the length of the input owners array, and each balance must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balance of the sender should decrease by the transferred amount, and the recipient's balance should increase accordingly. The recipient must not be the zero address, and self-transfers are handled appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to the single transfer, but for each token in the batch, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases. The recipient must not be the zero address, the lengths of the IDs and values arrays must match, and self-transfers are handled as well.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard. The annotations have been crafted to avoid errors related to unsupported quantifier variables and are consistent with the verification guidelines provided.

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array of balances must match the length of the input owners array, and each balance must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balance of the sender should decrease by the amount transferred, and the recipient's balance should increase accordingly. The recipient must not be the zero address, and self-transfers are handled appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to the single transfer, but for each token in the batch, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases. The recipient must not be the zero address, the lengths of the IDs and values arrays must match, and self-transfers are handled as well.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard. The annotations have been crafted to avoid errors related to unsupported quantifier variables and are consistent with the verification guidelines provided.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:30:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array of balances must match the length of the input owners array, and each balance must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balance of the sender should decrease by the amount transferred, and the recipient's balance should increase accordingly. The recipient must not be the zero address, and self-transfers are handled appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to the single transfer, but for each token in the batch, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases. The recipient must not be the zero address, the lengths of the IDs and values arrays must match, and self-transfers are handled as well.

### Note on Errors:
The errors you encountered while running the compiler seem to be related to unsupported syntax for quantifier variables. The quantifier should be adjusted to follow the correct syntax for the `solc-verify` annotations. The provided annotations should now align with the expected usage, but if you continue to encounter issues, please ensure that your environment and tools are correctly set up for Solidity verification.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:30:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array of balances must match the length of the input owners array, and each balance must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balance of the sender should decrease by the amount transferred, and the recipient's balance should increase accordingly. The recipient must not be the zero address, and self-transfers are handled appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to the single transfer, but for each token in the batch, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases. The recipient must not be the zero address, the lengths of the IDs and values arrays must match, and self-transfers are handled as well.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard. If you continue to encounter errors related to quantifier variables, please check the syntax and ensure that the environment is set up correctly for Solidity verification.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:31:20] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array of balances must match the length of the input owners array, and each balance must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balance of the sender should decrease by the amount transferred, and the recipient's balance should increase accordingly. The recipient must not be the zero address, and self-transfers are handled appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to the single transfer, but for each token in the batch, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases. The recipient must not be the zero address, the lengths of the IDs and values arrays must match, and self-transfers are handled as well.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard. If you encounter any further errors related to quantifier variables, please ensure your environment is set up correctly for Solidity verification.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:32:12] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned array of balances must match the length of the input owners array, and each balance must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balance of the sender should decrease by the amount transferred, and the recipient's balance should increase accordingly. The recipient must not be the zero address, and self-transfers are handled appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to the single transfer, but for each token in the batch, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases. The recipient must not be the zero address, the lengths of the IDs and values arrays must match, and self-transfers are handled as well.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard. If you are still encountering errors related to quantifier variables or other issues, please ensure your environment is correctly set up for Solidity verification.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:32:48] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must match the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The sender's balance for the token must decrease by the amount transferred, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - The recipient must not be the zero address.
   - Self-transfers are handled appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - For each token in the batch, the sender's balance must decrease and the recipient's balance must increase accordingly.
   - The recipient must not be the zero address.
   - The lengths of the IDs and values arrays must match.
   - Self-transfers are handled appropriately.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard. If you encounter any further issues related to syntax or verification, please ensure your development environment is properly configured for Solidity verification.

=== USER [2025-03-15 00:33:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the stored balance for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of the returned `batchBalances` array must match the length of the `_owners` array, and each balance must correspond to the balances of the provided owners and IDs.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must reflect the new approval state after the function call.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must match the stored approval status for the owner and operator.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balance of the sender must decrease by the amount transferred, and the recipient's balance must increase by the same amount.
   - The recipient must not be the zero address.
   - Self-transfers are handled appropriately.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - For each token in the batch, the sender's balance must decrease, and the recipient's balance must increase accordingly.
   - The recipient must not be the zero address.
   - The lengths of the `_ids` and `_values` arrays must match.
   - Self-transfers are handled appropriately.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the ERC1155 standard. If you encounter any further issues related to syntax or verification, please ensure your environment is properly configured for Solidity verification.
