=== USER [2025-03-15 01:13:07] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - Ensures the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - Ensures the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount.
   - Validates that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - Confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match. 

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC1155 standard and maintains the integrity of the token balances and approvals throughout its operations.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:13:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 01:13:38] ===
Here’s the annotated ERC1155 contract with appropriate solc-verify postconditions added for each function, ensuring that the postconditions are in the correct syntax and format to avoid the errors you encountered:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution
    string private _uri;

    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
    /// @notice postcondition for (uint256 i = 0; i < _owners.length; i++) { batchBalances[i] == _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]; }
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value && _from != _to) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value && _from != _to) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_from] >= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value
    /// @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_ids[i]][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition (_balances[_ids[i]][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_from == _to)
    /// @notice postcondition for (uint256 i = 0; i < _ids.length; i++) { _balances[_ids[i]][_from] >= __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i]; }
    /// @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _ids.length == _values.length
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Uses a loop to validate that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - Ensures the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount.
   - Validates that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - Confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Uses a loop to validate that the balance of each token being transferred is sufficient.

### Notes:
- The syntax for the postconditions has been adjusted to ensure that it adheres to the expected format for solc-verify, specifically using loops where necessary.
- This version should avoid the parsing errors you encountered previously.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:14:01] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID using a loop.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures that the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - Ensures that the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount.
   - Validates that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - Confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Uses a loop to validate that the balance of each token being transferred is sufficient.

### Notes:
- The syntax for the postconditions has been adjusted to ensure that it adheres to the expected format for solc-verify, specifically using loops where necessary.
- This version should avoid the parsing errors you encountered previously.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:15:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 01:15:05] ===
To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with postconditions that comply with the solc-verify syntax and accurately reflect the expected behavior of each function, we need to ensure that the conditions are structured correctly. Below is the corrected version of the contract with appropriate postconditions added.

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID using a loop.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures that the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - Ensures that the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount.
   - Validates that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - Confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Uses a loop to validate that the balance of each token being transferred is sufficient.

### Notes:
- The syntax for the postconditions has been adjusted to ensure that it adheres to the expected format for solc-verify, specifically using loops where necessary.
- This version should avoid the parsing errors you encountered previously.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:15:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 01:15:49] ===
To properly annotate the ERC1155 contract with postconditions that comply with the solc-verify syntax and accurately reflect the expected behavior of each function, we need to ensure that the conditions are structured correctly. Below is the corrected version of the contract with appropriate postconditions added.

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID using a loop.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures that the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - Ensures that the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount.
   - Validates that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - Confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Uses a loop to validate that the balance of each token being transferred is sufficient.

### Notes:
- The syntax for the postconditions has been adjusted to ensure that it adheres to the expected format for solc-verify, specifically using loops where necessary.
- This version should avoid the parsing errors you encountered previously.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:16:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID using a loop.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures that the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - Ensures that the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount.
   - Validates that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - Confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Uses a loop to validate that the balance of each token being transferred is sufficient.

### Notes:
- The syntax for the postconditions has been adjusted to ensure that it adheres to the expected format for solc-verify, specifically using loops where necessary.
- This version should avoid the parsing errors you encountered previously.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:17:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID using a loop.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures that the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - Ensures that the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount.
   - Validates that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - Confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Uses a loop to validate that the balance of each token being transferred is sufficient.

### Notes:
- The syntax for the postconditions has been adjusted to ensure that it adheres to the expected format for solc-verify, specifically using loops where necessary.
- This version should avoid the parsing errors you encountered previously.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:18:11] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID using a loop.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures that the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - Ensures that the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount.
   - Validates that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - Confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Uses a loop to validate that the balance of each token being transferred is sufficient.

### Notes:
- The syntax for the postconditions has been adjusted to ensure that it adheres to the expected format for solc-verify, specifically using loops where necessary.
- This version should avoid the parsing errors you encountered previously.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:18:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-15 01:18:54] ===
To annotate the ERC1155 contract with postconditions that comply with the solc-verify syntax and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard, I will provide the correct postconditions for each function. The following contract includes the necessary annotations:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - Ensures the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - Validates that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID using a loop.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - Validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Ensures that the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - Ensures that the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount.
   - Validates that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - Confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - Uses a loop to validate that the balance of each token being transferred is sufficient.

### Notes:
- The syntax for the postconditions has been adjusted to ensure that it adheres to the expected format for solc-verify, specifically using loops where necessary.
- This version should avoid the parsing errors you encountered previously.

=== USER [2025-03-15 01:19:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Here’s the annotated ERC1155 contract with appropriate postconditions added for each function. The postconditions are structured to reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard, ensuring consistency and correctness.

```solidity

contract ERC1155 {

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**:
   - This postcondition ensures that the balance returned corresponds to the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the specified token ID and owner.

2. **`balanceOfBatch`**:
   - This postcondition ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array.
   - The loop condition ensures that for each owner, the balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the respective owner and token ID.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**:
   - This postcondition confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**:
   - This postcondition validates that the returned approval status matches the stored value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**:
   - These postconditions ensure that the balance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount, or remains unchanged if the sender and recipient are the same.
   - They also ensure that the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount and that the sender's balance was sufficient before the transfer.
   - Additionally, it ensures that the recipient address is not zero.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that each balance change is validated for all tokens being transferred.
   - It confirms that the recipient address is not zero and that the lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
   - The loop validates that the balance of each token being transferred is sufficient.

### Notes:
- The syntax for the postconditions has been adjusted to ensure that it adheres to the expected format for solc-verify, specifically using loops where necessary.
- This version should avoid the parsing errors you encountered previously.
