=== USER [2025-03-14 23:16:04] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping.
   
2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that the length of the returned balances matches the length of the owners array and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Ensures that the approval status for the operator is set correctly.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that the balance of the sender decreases by the value transferred and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount. It also handles the case where the sender and recipient are the same.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Validates that for each token ID in the batch, the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts. It also ensures that the changes are consistent across all transfers in the batch. 

These postconditions are crafted to reflect the expected behavior as described in the ERC1155 specification.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:16:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-14 23:16:34] ===
Here’s the corrected version of the smart contract interface with appropriate postconditions added for each function, formatted according to the `solc-verify` syntax. The annotations provided ensure that the conditions reflect the expected behaviors as per the ERC1155 standard:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /// @notice postcondition _balances[_owner][_id] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /// @notice postcondition batchBalances.length == _owners.length
    /// @notice postcondition (batchBalances[i] == _balances[_owners[i]][_ids[i]]) for all i in [0, _owners.length)
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;

    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

    /// @notice postcondition ( (_balances[_from][_id] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_id]) - _value && _from != _to) || (_balances[_from][_id] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_id]) && _from == _to) ) && success || !success
    /// @notice postcondition ( (_balances[_to][_id] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_id]) + _value && _from != _to) || (_balances[_to][_id] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_id]) && _from == _to) ) && success || !success
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /// @notice postcondition ( (_balances[_from][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_ids[i]]) - _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_balances[_from][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_ids[i]]) && _from == _to) ) && success || !success for all i in [0, _ids.length)
    /// @notice postcondition ( (_balances[_to][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_ids[i]]) + _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_balances[_to][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_ids[i]]) && _from == _to) ) && success || !success for all i in [0, _ids.length)
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Verifies that the returned balance for the specified token ID and owner matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` array matches the length of the `_owners` array, and for each index, the balance matches the corresponding value in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator matches the value passed to the function.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount, handling both self-transfers and transfers to others.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It checks that each sender's balance decreases and each recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts for all token IDs in the batch, ensuring the operation is valid.

These postconditions are structured to adhere strictly to the ERC1155 specification and ensure that the contract functions as intended while providing formal verification points for the implementation.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:16:57] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        
        ```solidity
            pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance matches the balance stored in the `_balances` mapping for the specified owner and token ID.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the length of the `_owners` array, and that each balance in `batchBalances` corresponds to the balance of the respective owner and token ID in the `_balances` mapping.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator matches the value passed to the function, ensuring the approval is correctly set or revoked.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount, handling both self-transfers and transfers to others.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It checks that each sender's balance decreases and each recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts for all token IDs in the batch, ensuring the operation is valid.

These postconditions are structured to adhere strictly to the ERC1155 specification and ensure that the contract functions as intended while providing formal verification points for the implementation.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:17:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance for the specified token ID and owner matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the length of the `_owners` array, and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount, handling both self-transfers and transfers to others.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It checks that each sender's balance decreases and each recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts for all token IDs in the batch.

These postconditions are crafted to reflect the expected behavior as described in the ERC1155 specification while ensuring consistency across all functions.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:18:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance for the specified token ID and owner matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the length of the `_owners` array and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount, handling both self-transfers and transfers to others.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It checks that each sender's balance decreases and each recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts for all token IDs in the batch.

### Note:
- The postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior is consistent with the ERC1155 standard, and the conditions are structured to allow for formal verification using the `solc-verify` tool.
- The postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` include checks for each index in the array, ensuring that the transfer logic is correctly applied to all tokens being transferred in the batch.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:18:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance for the specified token ID and owner matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the length of the `_owners` array and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount, handling both self-transfers and transfers to others.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It checks that each sender's balance decreases and each recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts for all token IDs in the batch.

### Important Notes:
- Each postcondition is structured to reflect the expected behavior as described in the ERC1155 specification.
- The conditions ensure that the contract's behavior is consistent and can be formally verified using the `solc-verify` tool.
- The postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` ensure that the conditions apply to each index in the array, maintaining correctness across multiple transfers.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:19:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned balance for the specified token ID and owner matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the length of the `_owners` array and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly, reflecting the value passed to the function.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - **Postconditions**: 
     - Validates that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount, handling both self-transfers and transfers to others.
     - Handles success and failure cases properly.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - **Postconditions**: 
     - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It checks that each sender's balance decreases and each recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts for all token IDs in the batch.
     - Ensures that the operations are valid for each index in the arrays.

### Important Notes:
- The postconditions are structured to reflect the expected behavior as described in the ERC1155 specification.
- Each condition ensures that the contract's behavior is consistent and can be formally verified using the `solc-verify` tool.
- The postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` ensure that the conditions apply to each index in the array, maintaining correctness across multiple transfers.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:21:19] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned balance for the specified token ID and owner matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the length of the `_owners` array and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly, reflecting the value passed to the function.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - **Postconditions**: 
     - Validates that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount, handling both self-transfers and transfers to others.
     - Handles success and failure cases properly.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - **Postconditions**: 
     - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It checks that each sender's balance decreases and each recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts for all token IDs in the batch.
     - Ensures that the operations are valid for each index in the arrays.

These postconditions are structured to adhere strictly to the ERC1155 specification and ensure that the contract functions as intended while providing formal verification points for the implementation.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:21:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-14 23:22:07] ===
Here’s the annotated ERC1155 smart contract interface with appropriate postconditions added for each function, ensuring compliance with the ERC1155 standard and using the `solc-verify` syntax. Each postcondition reflects the expected behavior as described in the ERC specification:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155  {

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    string private _uri;

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned balance for the specified token ID and owner matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the length of the `_owners` array and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly, reflecting the value passed to the function.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - **Postconditions**: 
     - Validates that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount, handling both self-transfers and transfers to others.
     - Handles success and failure cases properly.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - **Postconditions**: 
     - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It checks that each sender's balance decreases and each recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts for all token IDs in the batch.
     - Ensures that the operations are valid for each index in the arrays.

These postconditions are structured to adhere strictly to the ERC1155 specification and ensure that the contract functions as intended while providing formal verification points for the implementation.

=== USER [2025-03-14 23:22:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Here’s the annotated ERC1155 smart contract interface with appropriate postconditions added for each function, ensuring compliance with the ERC1155 standard and using the `solc-verify` syntax. Each postcondition reflects the expected behavior as described in the ERC specification:

```solidity

    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned balance for the specified token ID and owner matches the value stored in the `_balances` mapping. This is represented as `_balances[_owner][_id] == balance`.

2. **balanceOfBatch**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the length of the returned `batchBalances` matches the length of the `_owners` array and that each balance corresponds to the correct owner and token ID. This is represented as `batchBalances.length == _owners.length` and `batchBalances[i] == _balances[_owners[i]][_ids[i]] for all i in [0, _owners.length)`.

3. **setApprovalForAll**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is set correctly, reflecting the value passed to the function. This is represented as `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved`.

4. **isApprovedForAll**: 
   - **Postcondition**: Ensures that the returned approval status matches the stored approval status for the specified owner and operator. This is represented as `approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

5. **safeTransferFrom**: 
   - **Postconditions**: 
     - Validates that the sender's balance decreases by the transferred amount and the recipient's balance increases by the same amount, handling both self-transfers and transfers to others. This is represented as:
       - `(_balances[_from][_id] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_id]) - _value && _from != _to) || (_balances[_from][_id] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_id]) && _from == _to)`
       - `(_balances[_to][_id] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_id]) + _value && _from != _to) || (_balances[_to][_id] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_id]) && _from == _to)`
     - Handles success and failure cases properly by including `&& success || !success`.

6. **safeBatchTransferFrom**: 
   - **Postconditions**: 
     - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers. It checks that each sender's balance decreases and each recipient's balance increases by the respective amounts for all token IDs in the batch. This is represented as:
       - `(_balances[_from][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_ids[i]]) - _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_balances[_from][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_ids[i]]) && _from == _to)`
       - `(_balances[_to][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_ids[i]]) + _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_balances[_to][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_ids[i]]) && _from == _to)`
     - Ensures that the operations are valid for each index in the arrays, handling success and failure cases similarly.

### Important Notes:
- The postconditions are structured to reflect the expected behavior as described in the ERC1155 specification.
- Each condition ensures that the contract's behavior is consistent and can be formally verified using the `solc-verify` tool.
- The postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` ensure that the conditions apply to each index in the array, maintaining correctness across multiple transfers.
