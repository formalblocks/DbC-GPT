=== USER [2025-03-14 22:42:25] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance should match the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: The length of `batchBalances` should match the length of `_owners`, and each balance should correspond to the respective owner and token ID.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated in `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must reflect the current state of the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: The balances must be updated correctly according to the transfer rules, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases. Special handling for self-transfers is also included.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated according to the arrays provided.

This ensures that the contract adheres to the ERC1155 standard while also providing formal verification conditions for the functions.

=== USER [2025-03-14 22:43:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Changes and Corrections:
1. **Corrected Postcondition Syntax**: The postcondition syntax has been corrected to ensure it adheres to the expected format without introducing any errors.
2. **Batch Postconditions**: The postconditions for `balanceOfBatch` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` now correctly use a format that indicates the conditions apply for all valid indices `i` in their respective arrays.
3. **Type Consistency**: Ensured that all references to state variables and parameters are consistent with the specified types in the contract.

This annotated contract should now compile without errors and provide the required formal verification conditions for each function according to the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 22:43:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must equal the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the respective owner's balance for the token ID in `_ids`.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must accurately reflect the current state of the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balances for both the sender and the recipient must be updated correctly according to the transfer rules.
   - Special handling for self-transfers is included.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that all balances are updated according to the arrays provided.

These annotations should resolve the compilation errors and provide the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC1155 contract.

=== USER [2025-03-14 22:44:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
1. **Postconditions**:
   - Each function has been annotated with postconditions that accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.
   - The conditions check balances before and after transfers, ensuring they are updated accordingly.

2. **Consistency**:
   - The postconditions are consistent across functions that relate to balance checks, approvals, and transfers.

3. **Correct Syntax**:
   - The postconditions are formatted correctly to avoid the compilation errors you encountered previously.

This annotated contract should now compile successfully and provide the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC1155 contract.

=== USER [2025-03-14 22:44:52] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance should equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` should match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` should correspond to the respective owner's balance for the token ID in `_ids`.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must reflect the current state of the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balances must be updated correctly according to the transfer rules, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases.
   - Special handling for self-transfers is included.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring all balances are updated according to the arrays provided.

These annotations should help you compile the contract successfully while providing the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC1155 contract.

=== USER [2025-03-14 22:45:32] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the respective owner's balance for the token ID in `_ids`.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must reflect the current state of the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balances must be updated correctly according to the transfer rules, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases.
   - Special handling for self-transfers is included.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that all balances are updated according to the arrays provided.

These annotations should help you compile the contract successfully while providing the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC1155 contract.

=== USER [2025-03-14 22:46:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
1. **Postconditions**:
   - Each function has been annotated with postconditions that accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC1155 standard.
   - The conditions check balances before and after transfers, ensuring they are updated accordingly.

2. **Consistency**:
   - The postconditions are consistent across functions that relate to balance checks, approvals, and transfers.

3. **Correct Syntax**:
   - The postconditions are formatted correctly to avoid the compilation errors you encountered previously.

This annotated contract should now compile without errors and provide the required formal verification conditions for each function according to the ERC1155 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 22:46:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the respective owner's balance for the token ID in `_ids`.
3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The approval status for the operator must be updated in `_operatorApprovals`.
4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The returned approval status must reflect the current state of the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.
5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balances must be updated correctly according to the transfer rules, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases.
   - Special handling for self-transfers is included.
6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that all balances are updated according to the arrays provided.

These annotations should help you compile the contract successfully while providing the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC1155 contract.

=== USER [2025-03-14 22:47:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.
   
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the respective owner's balance for the token ID in `_ids`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must be updated in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The returned approval status must reflect the current state of the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balances must be updated correctly according to the transfer rules, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases.
   - Special handling for self-transfers is included.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that all balances are updated according to the arrays provided.

These annotations should help you compile the contract successfully while providing the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC1155 contract.

=== USER [2025-03-14 22:48:27] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        @param _from    Source address
        @param _to      Target address
        @param _ids     IDs of each token type (order and length must match _values array)
        @param _values  Transfer amounts per token type (order and length must match _ids array)
        @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to`

    /// @notice postcondition ( (_balances[_to][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_ids[i]]) + _values[i] && _from != _to) || (_balances[_to][_ids[i]] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to][_ids[i]]) && _from == _to) ) for all valid i

}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: 
   - The returned balance must equal the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner` and `_id`.
   
2. **`balanceOfBatch`**: 
   - The length of `batchBalances` must match the length of `_owners`.
   - Each balance in `batchBalances` must correspond to the respective owner's balance for the token ID in `_ids`.

3. **`setApprovalForAll`**: 
   - The approval status for the operator must be updated in `_operatorApprovals`.

4. **`isApprovedForAll`**: 
   - The returned approval status must reflect the current state of the `_operatorApprovals` mapping.

5. **`safeTransferFrom`**: 
   - The balances must be updated correctly according to the transfer rules, ensuring that the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases.
   - Special handling for self-transfers is included.

6. **`safeBatchTransferFrom`**: 
   - Similar to `safeTransferFrom`, but for batch transfers, ensuring that all balances are updated according to the arrays provided.

These annotations should help you compile the contract successfully while providing the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC1155 contract.
