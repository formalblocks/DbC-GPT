=== USER [2025-03-14 01:57:30] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: The balance must be non-negative and equal to the count of tokens owned by the specified address.
2. **ownerOf**: The returned owner address must match the address stored for the given token ID.
3. **approve**: The approval for the token ID must be updated to the new approved address, and the caller must be authorized.
4. **getApproved**: The returned approved address must match the stored approval for the specified token ID.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: The operator's approval status must be updated correctly.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: The return value must reflect the approval status of the operator for the owner.
7. **transferFrom**: The transfer must ensure the `to` address is not zero, and the ownership must correctly reflect the transfer.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, with additional checks for contract reception (although not explicitly checked in this specification).
9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Same conditions as the previous safe transfer, ensuring the ownership reflects the transfer.

This ensures that the contract functions adhere to the ERC721 standard and maintains the integrity of the token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:58:02] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative and equals the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.
   
2. **ownerOf**:
   - Ensures the returned address matches the recorded owner of the specified token ID.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensures the approval for the token ID is updated correctly, and the caller is authorized to make this change.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures the return value correctly reflects the approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures the transfer is valid, the recipient is not the zero address, and the ownership is updated correctly. Also checks that the caller is authorized.

8. **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads):
   - Similar checks as `transferFrom`, ensuring the recipient is valid and the ownership updates correctly.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard, maintaining integrity in token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:58:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative and equals the number of NFTs owned by the specified address.

2. **ownerOf**:
   - Ensures the returned owner address matches the address stored for the given token ID.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensures the approval for the token ID is updated to the new approved address, and the caller is authorized to make this change.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures the return value reflects the approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures the transfer is valid (the recipient is not the zero address), the ownership is updated correctly, and the caller has the necessary permissions.

8. **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads):
   - Similar checks as `transferFrom`, ensuring the recipient is valid and the ownership updates correctly, with additional checks for smart contract interactions.

These postconditions ensure that the contract functions adhere to the ERC721 standard, maintaining the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 01:59:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

   - Ensures the approval for the token ID is updated to the new approved address, and the caller is authorized to make this change.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:

        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative and equals the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.

2. **ownerOf**:
   - Ensures the returned owner address matches the address stored for the given token ID.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensures the approval for the token ID is updated to the new approved address, and the caller is authorized to make this change.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures the return value reflects the approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures the transfer is valid (the recipient is not the zero address), the ownership is updated correctly, and the caller has the necessary permissions.

8. **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads):
   - Similar checks as `transferFrom`, ensuring the recipient is valid and the ownership updates correctly, with additional checks for smart contract interactions.

These postconditions ensure that the contract functions adhere to the ERC721 standard, maintaining the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative and equals the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.

2. **ownerOf**:
   - Ensures the returned owner address matches the address stored for the given token ID.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensures the approval for the token ID is updated to the new approved address, and the caller is authorized to make this change.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures the return value reflects the approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures the transfer is valid (the recipient is not the zero address), the ownership is updated correctly, and the caller has the necessary permissions.

8. **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads):
   - Similar checks as `transferFrom`, ensuring the recipient is valid and the ownership updates correctly, with additional checks for smart contract interactions.

These postconditions ensure that the contract functions adhere to the ERC721 standard, maintaining the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 02:02:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative and equals the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.

2. **ownerOf**:
   - Ensures the returned owner address matches the address stored for the given token ID.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensures the approval for the token ID is updated to the new approved address, and the caller is authorized to make this change.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures the return value reflects the approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures the transfer is valid (the recipient is not the zero address), the ownership is updated correctly, and the caller has the necessary permissions.

8. **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads):
   - Similar checks as `transferFrom`, ensuring the recipient is valid and the ownership updates correctly, with additional checks for smart contract interactions.

These postconditions ensure that the contract functions adhere to the ERC721 standard, maintaining the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative and equals the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.

2. **ownerOf**:
   - Ensures the returned owner address matches the address stored for the given token ID.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensures the approval for the token ID is updated to the new approved address, and the caller is authorized to make this change.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures the return value reflects the approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures the transfer is valid (the recipient is not the zero address), the ownership is updated correctly, and the caller has the necessary permissions.

8. **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads):
   - Similar checks as `transferFrom`, ensuring the recipient is valid and the ownership updates correctly, with additional checks for smart contract interactions.

These postconditions ensure that the contract functions adhere to the ERC721 standard, maintaining the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.

=== USER [2025-03-14 02:04:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**:
   - Ensures the balance is non-negative and equals the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.

2. **ownerOf**:
   - Ensures the returned owner address matches the address stored for the given token ID.

3. **approve**:
   - Ensures the approval for the token ID is updated to the new approved address, and the caller is authorized to make this change.

4. **getApproved**:
   - Ensures the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the specified token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**:
   - Ensures the operator's approval status is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**:
   - Ensures the return value reflects the approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**:
   - Ensures the transfer is valid (the recipient is not the zero address), the ownership is updated correctly, and the caller has the necessary permissions.

8. **safeTransferFrom** (both overloads):
   - Similar checks as `transferFrom`, ensuring the recipient is valid and the ownership updates correctly, with additional checks for smart contract interactions.

These postconditions ensure that the contract functions adhere to the ERC721 standard, maintaining the integrity of token ownership and approval mechanisms.
