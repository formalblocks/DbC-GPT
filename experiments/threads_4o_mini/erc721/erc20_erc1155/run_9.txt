=== USER [2025-03-14 16:41:05] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Postcondition ensures that the balance of the owner matches the returned balance.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Postcondition checks that the owner of the token ID matches the returned address.
3. **`approve`**: Postcondition verifies that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly and handles success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: Postcondition ensures that the returned approved address matches the state variable.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Postcondition checks that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Postcondition ensures that the approval status returned matches the state variable.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Postconditions ensure that the owner of the token ID is updated correctly and checks for success and failure cases.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for smart contract handling.
   
These postconditions are designed to match the expected behaviors specified in the ERC721 standard while adhering to the provided verification guidelines.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:41:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: The postcondition ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_owner` matches the returned balance.
2. **`ownerOf`**: The postcondition checks that the owner of the token ID matches the returned address.
3. **`approve`**: The postcondition verifies that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly and handles success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: The postcondition ensures that the returned approved address matches the state variable.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: The postcondition checks that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: The postcondition ensures that the approval status returned matches the state variable.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Postconditions ensure that the owner of the token ID is updated correctly and checks for success and failure cases.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for smart contract handling.

These postconditions are designed to match the expected behaviors specified in the ERC721 standard while adhering to the provided verification guidelines. If you encounter any errors while compiling or verifying, please ensure that the postconditions are correctly referenced and that all state variables are correctly identified.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:42:06] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Verifies that the number of NFTs owned by `_owner` matches the returned balance.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID matches the returned address.
3. **`approve`**: Ensures that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly, handling both success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: Checks that the returned approved address matches the state variable.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Validates that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status returned matches the state variable.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID is updated correctly and checks for success and failure cases.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for smart contract handling.

These postconditions should align with the ERC721 standard and the specified verification guidelines. If you encounter any errors during compilation, please ensure that the postconditions are correctly referenced and that all state variables are properly identified.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:42:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_owner` matches the returned balance.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID matches the returned address.
3. **`approve`**: Verifies that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly, handling both success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: Checks that the returned approved address matches the state variable.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Validates that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status returned matches the state variable.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID is updated correctly and checks for success and failure cases.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for smart contract handling.

These postconditions should align with the ERC721 standard and the specified verification guidelines. If you encounter any errors during compilation, please ensure that the postconditions are correctly referenced and that all state variables are properly identified.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:43:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_owner` matches the returned balance.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID matches the returned address.
3. **`approve`**: Verifies that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly, handling both success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: Checks that the returned approved address matches the state variable.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Validates that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status returned matches the state variable.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID is updated correctly and checks for success and failure cases.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for smart contract handling.

These postconditions align with the ERC721 standard and the specified verification guidelines. If you encounter any errors during compilation, please ensure that the postconditions are correctly referenced and that all state variables are properly identified.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:44:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_owner` matches the returned balance.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID matches the returned address.
3. **`approve`**: Verifies that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly, handling both success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: Checks that the returned approved address matches the state variable.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Validates that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status returned matches the state variable.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID is updated correctly and checks for success and failure cases.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for smart contract handling.

These postconditions align with the ERC721 standard and the specified verification guidelines. If you encounter any errors during compilation, please ensure that the postconditions are correctly referenced and that all state variables are properly identified.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:45:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_owner` matches the returned balance.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID matches the returned address.
3. **`approve`**: Verifies that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly, handling both success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: Checks that the returned approved address matches the state variable.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Validates that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status returned matches the state variable.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID is updated correctly and checks for success and failure cases.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for smart contract handling.

These postconditions align with the ERC721 standard and the specified verification guidelines. If you encounter any errors during compilation, please ensure that the postconditions are correctly referenced and that all state variables are properly identified.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:45:58] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_owner` matches the returned balance.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID matches the returned address.
3. **`approve`**: Verifies that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly, handling both success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: Checks that the returned approved address matches the state variable.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Validates that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status returned matches the state variable.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID is updated correctly and checks for success and failure cases.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for smart contract handling.

These postconditions align with the ERC721 standard and the specified verification guidelines. If you encounter any errors during compilation, please ensure that the postconditions are correctly referenced and that all state variables are properly identified.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:47:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the number of NFTs owned by `_owner` matches the returned balance.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID matches the returned address.
3. **`approve`**: Verifies that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly, handling both success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: Checks that the returned approved address matches the state variable.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Validates that the operator's approval status is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Ensures that the approval status returned matches the state variable.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID is updated correctly and checks for success and failure cases.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for smart contract handling.

These postconditions align with the ERC721 standard and the specified verification guidelines. If you encounter any errors during compilation, please ensure that the postconditions are correctly referenced and that all state variables are properly identified.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the number of NFTs owned by `_owner`.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Confirms that the returned address is indeed the owner of the specified token ID.
3. **`approve`**: Verifies that the approval for the token ID is updated correctly, handling both success and failure cases.
4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address returned matches the state variable for the specified token ID.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Validates that the returned operator approval status matches the expected value.
