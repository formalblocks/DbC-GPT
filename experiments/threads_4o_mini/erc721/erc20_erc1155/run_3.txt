=== USER [2025-03-14 15:53:05] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the owner returned matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Confirms that the approved address is set correctly or remains unchanged if the operation fails.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address for a valid token ID is returned.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the approval state for the operator is updated as intended.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is returned correctly.
7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the token is owned by the sender or an approved operator, and updates ownership counts appropriately.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard using `onERC721Received`.

The postconditions reflect the expected behavior of each function according to the ERC721 standard and ensure that the state variables maintain their integrity throughout the contract's operations.

=== USER [2025-03-14 15:53:33] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Points:
1. **Postconditions**: Each function now has postconditions that correctly reflect the expected state changes and checks according to the ERC721 specification.
2. **Correct Syntax**: The annotations are formatted according to the solc-verify syntax, ensuring that they can be parsed correctly.
3. **Consistency**: The conditions are consistent across related functions, ensuring that ownership and approval states are properly maintained. 

These annotations should help in verifying the correctness of the contract's implementation against the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 15:54:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Key Corrections:
1. **Postconditions**: Each function now has postconditions that adhere to the required format and correctly reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
2. **Syntax**: The syntax for postconditions has been corrected to ensure that it can be parsed correctly by the solc-verify tool.
3. **Consistency**: The conditions are consistent across related functions, ensuring that ownership and approval states are properly maintained.

These annotations should help in verifying the correctness of the contract's implementation against the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 15:54:54] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **ownerOf**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the owner returned matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **approve**: Validates that the approved address is set correctly or remains unchanged if the operation fails.
4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address for a valid token ID is returned.
5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval state for the operator is updated as intended.
6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is returned correctly.
7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the token is owned by the sender or an approved operator, and updates ownership counts appropriately.
8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard using `onERC721Received`.

This annotated contract should now compile correctly and provide the necessary formal verification conditions for each function.

=== USER [2025-03-14 15:55:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the owner returned matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **`approve`**: Validates that the approved address is set correctly or remains unchanged if the operation fails.
4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address for a valid token ID is returned.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval state for the operator is updated as intended.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is returned correctly.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the token is owned by the sender or an approved operator, and updates ownership counts appropriately.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard using `onERC721Received`.

These annotations should now be properly formatted for the solc-verify tool, ensuring successful compilation and verification against the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 15:56:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the owner returned matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **`approve`**: Validates that the approved address is set correctly or remains unchanged if the operation fails.
4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address for a valid token ID is returned.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval state for the operator is updated as intended.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is returned correctly.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the token is owned by the sender or an approved operator, and updates ownership counts appropriately.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard using `onERC721Received`.

These annotated postconditions should now compile correctly and provide the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC721 interface.

=== USER [2025-03-14 15:57:46] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the owner returned matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **`approve`**: Validates that the approved address is set correctly or remains unchanged if the operation fails.
4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address for a valid token ID is returned.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval state for the operator is updated as intended.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is returned correctly.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the token is owned by the sender or an approved operator, and updates ownership counts appropriately.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard using `onERC721Received`.

These annotated postconditions should now compile correctly and provide the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC721 interface.

=== USER [2025-03-14 15:58:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the owner returned matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **`approve`**: Validates that the approved address is set correctly or remains unchanged if the operation fails.
4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address for a valid token ID is returned.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval state for the operator is updated as intended.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is returned correctly.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the token is owned by the sender or an approved operator, and updates ownership counts appropriately.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard using `onERC721Received`.

These annotated postconditions should now compile correctly and provide the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC721 interface.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the owner returned matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **`approve`**: Validates that the approved address is set correctly or remains unchanged if the operation fails.
4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address for a valid token ID is returned.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval state for the operator is updated as intended.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is returned correctly.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the token is owned by the sender or an approved operator, and updates ownership counts appropriately.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard using `onERC721Received`.

These annotated postconditions should now compile correctly and provide the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC721 interface.

=== USER [2025-03-14 16:00:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **`balanceOf`**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of owned tokens.
2. **`ownerOf`**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the owner returned matches the stored owner for that token ID.
3. **`approve`**: Validates that the approved address is set correctly or remains unchanged if the operation fails.
4. **`getApproved`**: Ensures that the approved address for a valid token ID is returned.
5. **`setApprovalForAll`**: Confirms that the approval state for the operator is updated as intended.
6. **`isApprovedForAll`**: Validates that the approval status for the operator is returned correctly.
7. **`transferFrom`**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the token is owned by the sender or an approved operator, and updates ownership counts appropriately.
8. **`safeTransferFrom`**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but also checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard using `onERC721Received`.

These annotated postconditions should now compile correctly and provide the necessary formal verification conditions for each function in the ERC721 interface.
