    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the owner is not the zero address, the balance returned equals the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that the token ID is valid and returns the correct owner address.

3. **approve**: Ensures that the approved address for the token ID is correctly set and that the caller is either the owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the returned approved address matches the stored approval for the token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard through the `onERC721Received` function.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard and maintain consistency across related functions.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the queried owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.

3. **approve**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is set correctly. It also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Verifies that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid, ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly while maintaining the correct count of owned tokens.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions are now correctly formatted for solc-verify and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:29:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the queried owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.

3. **approve**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is set correctly. It also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Verifies that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid by ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly while maintaining the correct count of owned tokens.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions are now correctly formatted for solc-verify and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:29:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the queried owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.

3. **approve**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is set correctly. It also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Verifies that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid by ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly while maintaining the correct count of owned tokens.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions are now correctly formatted for solc-verify and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:30:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the queried owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.

3. **approve**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is set correctly. It also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Verifies that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid by ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly while maintaining the correct count of owned tokens.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions are now correctly formatted for solc-verify and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:31:22] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the queried owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.

3. **approve**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is set correctly. It also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Verifies that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid by ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly while maintaining the correct count of owned tokens.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions are now correctly formatted for solc-verify and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the queried owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.

3. **approve**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is set correctly. It also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Verifies that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid by ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly while maintaining the correct count of owned tokens.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions are now correctly formatted for solc-verify and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:33:00] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the queried owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.

3. **approve**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is set correctly. It also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Verifies that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid by ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly while maintaining the correct count of owned tokens.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions are now correctly formatted for solc-verify and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:33:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the queried owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.

3. **approve**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is set correctly. It also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Verifies that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid by ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly while maintaining the correct count of owned tokens.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions are now correctly formatted for solc-verify and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-14 12:34:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that if the queried owner is not the zero address, the returned balance matches the count of NFTs owned by that address.

2. **ownerOf**: Validates that if the token ID is valid, the returned owner matches the stored owner for that token ID.

3. **approve**: Checks that if the token ID is valid, the approved address is set correctly. It also ensures that the caller is either the token owner or an authorized operator.

4. **getApproved**: Verifies that if the token ID is valid, the returned approved address matches the stored approval for that token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the operator's approval status is updated as intended.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Checks that the transfer is valid by ensuring the sender is authorized, and updates the ownership accordingly while maintaining the correct count of owned tokens.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but adds checks for contract compliance with the ERC721 standard.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Ensures the same conditions as the previous `safeTransferFrom`, ensuring the correct handling of the `data` parameter and contract compliance.

These postconditions are now correctly formatted for solc-verify and accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard.
