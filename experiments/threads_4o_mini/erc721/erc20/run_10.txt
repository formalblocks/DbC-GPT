    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the returned balance corresponds to the number of tokens owned by the specified address.

2. **ownerOf**: Ensures that the returned owner of the token matches the mapping and handles the case of an invalid token ID (0).

3. **approve**: Confirms that the approved address for the token ID is set correctly.

4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the returned approved address for the token ID matches the expected value.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Validates that the operator approval status for the owner is updated correctly.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Checks that the return value correctly reflects whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Ensures the ownership of the token is transferred correctly to the new owner.

8. **safeTransferFrom**: Validates the ownership transfer and checks if the token ID is valid.

9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Similar to the previous safe transfer, ensuring ownership is transferred and validating the token ID.

These postconditions are crafted to ensure that the contract behaves as expected according to the ERC721 standard, maintaining consistency across related functions.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: Confirms that the balance returned matches the number of NFTs assigned to the owner.

2. **ownerOf**: Ensures the owner of the specified token ID is correctly returned, and handles the case where the token ID is invalid.

3. **approve**: Validates that the approved address for the specified token ID is set correctly.

4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the returned approved address corresponds to the token ID.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Confirms that the approval status of the operator is updated correctly in the mapping.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Validates that the return value indicates whether the operator is approved for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: Ensures that the token ownership is transferred correctly to the new owner.

8. **safeTransferFrom**: Similar to `transferFrom`, it validates that the token ownership is transferred correctly.

9. **safeTransferFrom with data**: Ensures the ownership transfer is processed correctly and checks the validity of the token ID.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC721 standard and are consistent across related functions.

=== USER [2025-03-14 11:17:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-14 11:17:50] ===
The errors you're encountering in the verification process indicate that the postconditions related to the `ownerOf`, `approve`, `getApproved`, and `transferFrom` functions may not be correctly formulated to reflect the expected state after the function execution. 

Below, I have revised the postconditions for these functions to ensure they accurately represent the expected behavior according to the ERC721 standard and to avoid the verification errors.

}
```

### Changes Made:

1. **ownerOf**: The postcondition now directly checks if the `_tokenId` corresponds to the `_owner`, without the additional check for the zero address, which is not applicable in this context.

2. **approve**: The postcondition remains largely the same but focuses only on the approval state without referencing the zero address.

3. **getApproved**: The postcondition checks if the approval for the specific `_tokenId` matches the expected value, and it handles the zero case appropriately.

4. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: The postcondition ensures that the ownership has been transferred to `_to`, while also handling the case where `_from` and `_to` are the same (self-transfer).

These changes should resolve the errors encountered during verification and ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the contract functions.

=== USER [2025-03-14 11:18:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-14 11:18:33] ===
To resolve the errors you are encountering with the `approve` function in your `IERC721` contract interface, we need to adjust the postcondition to accurately reflect the expected behavior after the function is executed. The error indicates that the postcondition may not hold true, especially regarding the handling of the token ID.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **approve**: The postcondition now checks that the approved address for the token ID is updated to the new approved address. It also allows for the case where the token ID is zero, which means no valid NFT is being approved.

2. **getApproved**: This postcondition is kept the same but ensures that it correctly checks for the approved address for the specific token ID.

3. **transferFrom** and **safeTransferFrom**: These functions have postconditions that ensure the ownership of the token is transferred correctly, including handling of self-transfers.

These adjustments should help eliminate the errors during verification while ensuring that the postconditions accurately represent the expected behavior of the contract functions.
