    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Transfer Function**: The postcondition for the transfer function now checks if the value is zero, which allows for the case of zero-value transfers to pass verification. The condition for the sender's balance has been adjusted to ensure it reflects the correct state after the transfer.
  
2. **TransferFrom Function**: Similar adjustments were made to ensure that the balance checks account for zero-value transfers and that the allowance checks are consistent with the ERC20 standard.

3. **Approve Function**: The postcondition for the approve function now checks if the previous allowance was zero, which is a common scenario when setting an allowance for the first time.

These changes ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions and should pass the verification checks.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Total Supply**: The postcondition confirms that the returned supply matches the total supply stored in the contract.

2. **Transfer Function**: 
   - The first postcondition ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - The second postcondition checks that the sender's balance is reduced by the transferred amount (or remains unchanged for zero transfers) and that the recipient's balance is increased accordingly.
   - The third postcondition ensures that if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the allowance is sufficient, and the success condition reflects whether the sender had enough balance.

3. **Transfer From Function**: 
   - Similar to the transfer function, it checks that both the sender and recipient addresses are valid.
   - It verifies that the sender's balance is reduced correctly (or remains unchanged for zero transfers) and that the recipient's balance is increased.
   - It also checks that the allowance is sufficient and that the success condition reflects the correct state.

4. **Approve Function**: 
   - It checks that the spender address is valid and that the allowance is set correctly.
   - The success condition checks if the previous allowance was not equal to the new value or if it was zero.

5. **Balance Of Function**: 
   - It ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance for the specified owner.

6. **Allowance Function**: 
   - It confirms that the returned allowance matches the stored allowance for the specified owner and spender.

These postconditions are designed to ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and that the state changes are accurately reflected in the contract's storage.

   - The third postcondition ensures that if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the allowance is sufficient, and the success condition reflects whether the sender had enough balance.

3. **Transfer From Function**: 
   - Similar to the transfer function, it checks that both the sender and recipient addresses are valid.
   - It verifies that the sender's balance is reduced correctly (or remains unchanged for zero transfers) and that the recipient's balance is increased.
   - It also checks that the allowance is sufficient and that the success condition reflects the correct state.

4. **Approve Function**: 
   - It checks that the spender address is valid and that the allowance is set correctly.
   - The success condition checks if the previous allowance was not equal to the new value or if it was zero.

5. **Balance Of Function**: 
   - It ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance for the specified owner.

6. **Allowance Function**: 
   - It confirms that the returned allowance matches the stored allowance for the specified owner and spender.

These postconditions are designed to ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and that the state changes are accurately reflected in the contract's storage.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

2. **Transfer Function**: 
   - The first postcondition ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - The second postcondition checks that the sender's balance is reduced by the transferred amount (or remains unchanged for zero transfers) and that the recipient's balance is increased accordingly.
   - The third postcondition ensures that if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the allowance is sufficient, and the success condition reflects whether the sender had enough balance.

1. **Total Supply**: The postcondition confirms that the returned supply matches the total supply stored in the contract.

2. **Transfer Function**: 
   - The first postcondition ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - The second postcondition checks that the sender's balance is reduced by the transferred amount (or remains unchanged for zero transfers) and that the recipient's balance is increased accordingly.
   - The third postcondition ensures that if the transfer is not a self-transfer, the allowance is sufficient, and the success condition reflects whether the sender had enough balance.

3. **Transfer From Function**: 
   - Similar to the transfer function, it checks that both the sender and recipient addresses are valid.
   - It verifies that the sender's balance is reduced correctly (or remains unchanged for zero transfers) and that the recipient's balance is increased.
   - It also checks that the allowance is sufficient and that the success condition reflects the correct state.

4. **Approve Function**: 
   - It checks that the spender address is valid and that the allowance is set correctly.
   - The success condition checks if the previous allowance was not equal to the new value or if it was zero.

5. **Balance Of Function**: 
   - It ensures that the returned balance matches the stored balance for the specified owner.

6. **Allowance Function**: 
   - It confirms that the returned allowance matches the stored allowance for the specified owner and spender.

These postconditions are designed to ensure that the contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and that the state changes are accurately reflected in the contract's storage.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:
