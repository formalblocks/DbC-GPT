=== USER [2025-03-13 16:25:12] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;

    /**

    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

Here’s the annotated ERC20 contract with appropriate solc-verify postconditions added for each function:

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The total supply returned must equal the state variable `_totalSupply`.
2. **transfer**: 
   - The recipient address must not be zero.
   - If the transfer amount is greater than zero, the sender's balance must be sufficient.
   - The sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`.
   - The function should succeed if the transfer amount is greater than zero and must handle the success case properly.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Both sender and recipient addresses must not be zero.
   - If the transfer amount is greater than zero, the sender's balance must be sufficient.
   - The allowance must be sufficient for the transaction.
   - The sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`.
   - Similar to `transfer`, it must handle success and failure cases.
4. **approve**: 
   - The spender address must not be zero, and the allowance must be set to the specified value.
   - Success must be handled correctly.
5. **balanceOf**: The returned balance must match the balance stored in `_balances`.
6. **allowance**: The returned remaining allowance must match the allowance stored in `_allowed`. 

These postconditions ensure the contract adheres to the ERC20 standard and provides a clear specification for verification.

Based on the feedback from the verifier and the ERC20 standard, it seems that the postconditions for the `transfer`, `approve`, and `transferFrom` functions need to be adjusted to ensure they accurately reflect the function's behavior under all circumstances, including when the transfer amount is zero or when the function fails. Below are the corrected postconditions for each function:

```

### Explanation of Adjustments:

1. **Transfer Functions** (`transfer` and `transferFrom`):
   - Added conditions to check that if `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged for both the sender and the recipient.
   - Ensured that the success condition is checked properly, and if the transfer fails, it doesn't affect the balances.
   - Included a condition to check that the allowance is sufficient in `transferFrom`.

2. **Approve Function**:
   - Similar to the transfer functions, the success condition is handled, ensuring that the allowance is set correctly.

These adjustments should resolve the errors reported by the verifier, ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions in all scenarios.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-13 16:26:21] ===
To ensure that the postconditions for the ERC20 contract are correct and to resolve the errors reported by the verifier, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions. The postconditions should accurately reflect the expected behavior of these functions, particularly in handling both successful and unsuccessful cases, as well as the case when the transfer amount is zero.

Here’s the modified contract with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

}
```

### Key Adjustments Made:

1. **Transfer Functions** (`transfer` and `transferFrom`):
   - Ensured that the conditions check for both successful and unsuccessful cases, while also handling the zero transfer case.
   - The balances of both the sender and recipient are checked to ensure they remain consistent, even when `_value` is zero.

2. **Approve Function**:
   - Similar handling for the success condition as in the transfer functions.

### Verification Guidelines:
- The conditions now ensure that if a transfer is attempted with a value of zero, it does not change the balances of the sender and recipient.
- The allowance check in `transferFrom` ensures that the allowance is sufficient when the function is called.

These adjustments should help eliminate the errors reported by the verifier and maintain compliance with the ERC20 standard.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

2. **Approve Function**:
   - Similar handling for success and failure conditions as in the transfer functions.

### Verification Guidelines:
- The adjustments ensure that all possible outcomes are accounted for in the postconditions, including both success and failure scenarios.
- The conditions are consistent across all functions, ensuring that they adhere to the ERC20 standard.

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Adjustments Made:

1. **Transfer Functions** (`transfer` and `transferFrom`):
   - **Postconditions for success and failure**: The conditions now explicitly state that if the function succeeds (returns `true`), the balances must be updated accordingly, and if it fails, the old balances must remain unchanged.
   - **Zero Transfer Handling**: Added checks that ensure when `_value` is zero, the balances do not change.

2. **Approve Function**:
   - Similar handling for success and failure conditions as in the transfer functions.
   - Ensured that the allowance is set correctly.

### Verification Guidelines:
- The adjustments ensure that all possible outcomes are accounted for in the postconditions, including both success and failure scenarios.
- The conditions are consistent across all functions, ensuring that they adhere to the ERC20 standard.

These modifications should resolve the errors reported by the verifier and ensure compliance with the ERC20 standard.

To resolve the errors reported by the verifier for the ERC20 contract, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the contract's functions.

}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: 
   - The supply returned must equal the state variable `_totalSupply`.

2. **transfer**: 
   - The recipient address `_to` must not be zero.
   - The function must handle success and failure cases, where if `_value` is greater than zero and the transfer is successful, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. If `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Both `_from` and `_to` addresses must not be zero.
   - Similar to `transfer`, it must check for success and failure cases, ensuring that balances are updated correctly. The allowance must also be checked to ensure it is sufficient.

4. **approve**: 
   - The spender address `_spender` must not be zero, and the allowance must be set correctly.
   - The function must handle success and failure cases.

5. **balanceOf**: 
   - The returned balance must match the balance stored in `_balances`.

6. **allowance**: 
   - The returned remaining allowance must match the allowance stored in `_allowed`.

### Verification Guidelines:
- Each postcondition adheres to the ERC20 specifications and ensures that the contract behaves correctly under all scenarios.
- The conditions are consistent across all functions, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the ERC20 standard.

These modifications should help eliminate the errors reported by the verifier and ensure compliance with the ERC20 standard.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: 
   - The supply returned must equal the state variable `_totalSupply`.

2. **transfer**: 
   - The recipient address `_to` must not be zero.
   - The function checks if the sender has enough balance for the transfer.
   - If the transfer amount is greater than zero, the sender's balance must decrease by `_value`, and the recipient's balance must increase by `_value`. If `_value` is zero, balances remain unchanged.
   - The success condition must handle both success and failure cases.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Both `_from` and `_to` addresses must not be zero.
   - Similar checks as in `transfer` for balance sufficiency.
   - The function checks that the allowance is sufficient.
   - Balances are updated accordingly, and the success condition must handle both success and failure cases.

4. **approve**: 
   - The spender address `_spender` must not be zero, and the allowance must be set correctly.
   - The success condition must handle both success and failure cases.

5. **balanceOf**: 
   - The returned balance must match the balance stored in `_balances`.

6. **allowance**: 
   - The returned remaining allowance must match the allowance stored in `_allowed`.

### Verification Guidelines:
- Each postcondition adheres to the ERC20 specifications and ensures that the contract behaves correctly under all scenarios.
- The conditions are consistent across all functions, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the ERC20 standard.

These modifications should help eliminate the errors reported by the verifier and ensure compliance with the ERC20 standard.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-13 16:29:29] ===
To address the errors reported by the verifier for the ERC20 contract, we need to refine the postconditions for the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions. The postconditions must accurately reflect the expected behavior of these functions, especially in handling success and failure cases, and ensuring that state changes are validated correctly.

Here is the annotated contract with the appropriate postconditions added:

```solidity

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _spender != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value > 0) || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: 
   - The total supply returned must equal the state variable `_totalSupply`.

2. **transfer**: 
   - The recipient address `_to` must not be zero.
   - The function must handle success and failure cases, where if `_value` is greater than zero and the transfer is successful, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. If `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Both `_from` and `_to` addresses must not be zero.
   - Similar to `transfer`, it must check for success and failure cases, ensuring that balances are updated correctly. The allowance must also be checked to ensure it is sufficient.

4. **approve**: 
   - The spender address `_spender` must not be zero, and the allowance must be set correctly.
   - The function must handle success and failure cases.

5. **balanceOf**: 
   - The returned balance must match the balance stored in `_balances`.

6. **allowance**: 
   - The returned remaining allowance must match the allowance stored in `_allowed`.

### Verification Guidelines:
- Each postcondition adheres to the ERC20 specifications and ensures that the contract behaves correctly under all scenarios.
- The conditions are consistent across all functions, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the ERC20 standard.

These modifications should resolve the errors reported by the verifier and ensure compliance with the ERC20 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-13 16:30:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: 
   - The total supply returned must equal the state variable `_totalSupply`.

2. **transfer**: 
   - The recipient address `_to` must not be zero.
   - The function checks if the sender has enough balance for the transfer. If `_value` is greater than zero and the transfer is successful, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. If `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged.
   - The success condition must handle both success and failure cases.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Both `_from` and `_to` addresses must not be zero.
   - Similar checks as in `transfer` for balance sufficiency.
   - The function checks that the allowance is sufficient.
   - Balances are updated accordingly, and the success condition must handle both success and failure cases.

4. **approve**: 
   - The spender address `_spender` must not be zero, and the allowance must be set correctly.
   - The success condition must handle both success and failure cases.

5. **balanceOf**: 
   - The returned balance must match the balance stored in `_balances`.

6. **allowance**: 
   - The returned remaining allowance must match the allowance stored in `_allowed`.

### Verification Guidelines:
- Each postcondition adheres to the ERC20 specifications and ensures that the contract behaves correctly under all scenarios.
- The conditions are consistent across all functions, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the ERC20 standard.

These modifications should help eliminate the errors reported by the verifier and ensure compliance with the ERC20 standard.

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **totalSupply**: 
   - The total supply returned must equal the state variable `_totalSupply`.

2. **transfer**: 
   - The recipient address `_to` must not be zero.
   - The function checks if the sender has enough balance for the transfer. If `_value` is greater than zero and the transfer is successful, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. If `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged.
   - The success condition must handle both success and failure cases.

3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Both `_from` and `_to` addresses must not be zero.
   - Similar checks as in `transfer` for balance sufficiency.
   - The function checks that the allowance is sufficient.
   - Balances are updated accordingly, and the success condition must handle both success and failure cases.

4. **approve**: 
   - The spender address `_spender` must not be zero, and the allowance must be set correctly.
   - The success condition must handle both success and failure cases.

5. **balanceOf**: 
   - The returned balance must match the balance stored in `_balances`.

6. **allowance**: 
   - The returned remaining allowance must match the allowance stored in `_allowed`.

### Verification Guidelines:
- Each postcondition adheres to the ERC20 specifications and ensures that the contract behaves correctly under all scenarios.
- The conditions are consistent across all functions, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the ERC20 standard.

These modifications should help eliminate the errors reported by the verifier and ensure compliance with the ERC20 standard.
