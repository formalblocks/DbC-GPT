=== USER [2025-03-13 16:31:26] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

Here is the annotated ERC20 smart contract with appropriate postconditions added for each function according to the ERC standard:

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The returned supply should match the total supply of tokens tracked by the contract.
2. **transfer**: 
   - The recipient address must not be zero.
   - The sender must have enough balance to cover the transfer amount.
   - The sender's balance decreases by the transfer amount.
   - The recipient's balance increases by the transfer amount.
   - The success condition accounts for both successful transfers and the case where no transfer occurs (like transferring zero tokens).
3. **transferFrom**:
   - Both the sender and recipient addresses must not be zero.
   - The sender must have enough balance and allowance to cover the transfer.
   - The balances of both the sender and recipient are updated correctly.
   - The allowance for the sender is decreased by the transferred amount.
   - Similar to `transfer`, it accounts for both successful transfers and the case where no transfer occurs.
4. **approve**: 
   - The allowance for the spender must be set to the specified value.
   - The success condition checks for successful approval or the case where zero is approved.
5. **balanceOf**: The returned balance must match the balance stored in the contract for the specified owner.
6. **allowance**: The returned remaining allowance must match the allowance stored in the contract for the specified owner and spender.

Based on the feedback from the verification tool, I will adjust the postconditions for the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions to ensure they accurately reflect the state changes and handle potential failure cases more effectively. Here’s the revised contract with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _spender != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _value > 0) || (_value == 0 && success)
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - Added a postcondition to check that the sender's balance is sufficient before the transfer occurs.
   - Ensured that the success condition accommodates the case where zero tokens are transferred.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Included checks for the sender's and recipient's addresses being non-zero.
   - Added a postcondition to confirm that the allowance is sufficient before executing the transfer.
   - Adjusted the success condition to handle zero-value transfers appropriately.

3. **Approve Function**:
   - Ensured that the spender's address is non-zero and that the allowance is set correctly.
   - Updated the success condition to handle zero-value approvals.

These changes should resolve the errors reported by the verifier by ensuring that postconditions accurately reflect the expected state after function execution, including handling edge cases like zero transfers.

To address the errors reported by the verifier for the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions, I will revise the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior and maintain consistency with the ERC20 standard. Here’s the updated contract with the appropriate postconditions:

```solidity

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _to != address(0)

    */
    /// @notice postcondition _spender != address(0)

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - Added a postcondition to ensure that the recipient address is valid (not zero).
   - Confirmed that the sender's balance is sufficient before executing the transfer.
   - Updated the success condition to allow for zero-value transfers while ensuring that `_balances[_to]` remains unchanged if `_value` is zero.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Included checks for both the sender and recipient addresses being non-zero.
   - Added a postcondition to ensure the sender has sufficient balance and allowance before executing the transfer.
   - Updated the success condition to handle zero-value transfers appropriately.

3. **Approve Function**:
   - Added a postcondition to ensure that the spender's address is valid (not zero).
   - Updated the success condition to accommodate the case where the approval value is zero.

These adjustments should resolve the errors reported by the verifier by ensuring that postconditions accurately reflect the expected state after function execution, including handling edge cases like zero transfers and ensuring proper balances and allowances.

=== USER [2025-03-13 16:33:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of the Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - **Postcondition for `_to`**: Added a check that `_to` is not the zero address.
   - **Postcondition for sender's balance**: Ensured that the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer.
   - **Postconditions for balances**: Updated the conditions to ensure that the balances are adjusted correctly.
   - **Success Condition**: Adjusted to allow for zero-value transfers while ensuring the function returns success.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - **Postconditions for `_from` and `_to`**: Ensured both addresses are not the zero address.
   - **Postcondition for sender's balance**: Confirmed that the `_from` address has enough balance to cover the transfer.
   - **Postcondition for allowance**: Ensured that the allowance is sufficient.
   - **Success Condition**: Similar to the transfer function, it allows for zero-value transfers.

3. **Approve Function**:
   - **Postcondition for `_spender`**: Added a check that `_spender` is not the zero address.
   - **Success Condition**: Adjusted to handle zero-value approvals while ensuring the function returns success.

These changes ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the contract according to the ERC20 standard and address the errors reported by the verifier.

    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - **Postcondition for `_to`**: Added a check to ensure that the recipient address is not zero.
   - **Postcondition for sender's balance**: Confirmed that the sender has enough balance to cover the transfer amount.
   - **Postconditions for balances**: Updated to ensure that the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`.
   - **Success Condition**: Allows for zero-value transfers while ensuring the function returns success.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - **Postconditions for `_from` and `_to`**: Added checks to ensure both addresses are not zero.
   - **Postcondition for sender's balance**: Confirmed that the `_from` address has enough balance to cover the transfer.
   - **Postcondition for allowance**: Ensured that the allowance is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - **Postconditions for balances**: Ensured that the balances are adjusted correctly.
   - **Success Condition**: Similar to the transfer function, it allows for zero-value transfers.

3. **Approve Function**:
   - **Postcondition for `_spender`**: Added a check that the spender's address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: Adjusted to handle zero-value approvals while ensuring the function returns success.

### Key Considerations:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure that they reflect the changes made to the state variables after the function execution.
- Each success condition is designed to handle both successful and unsuccessful outcomes, ensuring that the contract behaves correctly according to the ERC20 standard.
- The checks for zero addresses help prevent any invalid operations that could lead to unintended consequences.

To ensure that the postconditions for the ERC20 smart contract functions accurately reflect the expected behavior and address the errors reported by the verifier, I will provide updated annotations for each function. These annotations will follow the solc-verify syntax and will ensure that the conditions are consistent with the ERC20 standard.

}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **Total Supply**:
   - The `totalSupply` function returns the total supply, which should match the `_totalSupply` state variable.

2. **Transfer Function**:
   - Checks that the recipient address `_to` is not zero.
   - Ensures the sender has enough balance to cover the transfer amount.
   - Updates the sender's balance by subtracting `_value` and the recipient's balance by adding `_value`.
   - Handles both successful transfers and the case where zero tokens are transferred.

3. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Ensures both `_from` and `_to` addresses are not zero.
   - Checks that the `_from` address has sufficient balance.
   - Updates the balances for both the sender and recipient.
   - Checks that the allowance is sufficient for the transfer.
   - Handles both successful transfers and the case where zero tokens are transferred.

4. **Approve Function**:
   - Ensures the spender's address is not zero.
   - Sets the allowance for the spender to the specified `_value`.
   - Handles both successful approvals and the case where zero tokens are approved.

5. **BalanceOf and Allowance Functions**:
   - Simply return the balance and allowance based on the state variables, ensuring that the return values match the expected values.

### Key Considerations:
- The postconditions are structured to reflect the expected state changes after function execution.
- Success conditions are designed to handle both successful and unsuccessful outcomes.
- The checks for zero addresses help prevent any invalid operations. 

This implementation should resolve the verifier's errors by ensuring that the postconditions accurately represent the contract's behavior according to the ERC20 standard.

   - **Postconditions for balances**: Updates the sender's balance by subtracting `_value` and the recipient's balance by adding `_value`.
   - **Success Condition**: Handles both successful transfers and the case where zero tokens are transferred without altering the recipient's balance.

3. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - **Postconditions for `_from` and `_to`**: Ensures both addresses are not zero.
   - **Postcondition for sender's balance**: Confirms that the `_from` address has enough balance to cover the transfer.
   - **Postcondition for allowance**: Ensures that the allowance is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - **Postconditions for balances**: Updates the balances for both the sender and recipient.
   - **Success Condition**: Similar to the transfer function, it allows for zero-value transfers.

4. **Approve Function**:
   - **Postcondition for `_spender`**: Ensures the spender's address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: Adjusted to handle zero-value approvals while ensuring the function returns success.

5. **BalanceOf and Allowance Functions**:
   - Simply return the balance and allowance based on the state variables, ensuring that the return values match the expected values.

To resolve the errors reported by the verifier for the `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions in the ERC20 smart contract, I will provide updated postconditions that accurately reflect the expected behavior according to the ERC20 standard. Below are the annotated postconditions for each function:

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _spender != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    /// @notice postcondition (success && (_value > 0 || _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]))) || !success
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Total Supply**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned `supply` matches the `_totalSupply` state variable.

2. **Transfer Function**:
   - **Postcondition for `_to`**: Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - **Postcondition for sender's balance**: Checks that the sender has enough balance to cover the transfer amount.
   - **Postconditions for balances**: Updates the sender's balance by subtracting `_value` and the recipient's balance by adding `_value`.
   - **Success Condition**: Allows for zero-value transfers while ensuring that the recipient's balance remains unchanged in that case.

3. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - **Postconditions for `_from` and `_to`**: Ensures both addresses are not zero.
   - **Postcondition for sender's balance**: Confirms that the `_from` address has enough balance to cover the transfer.
   - **Postcondition for allowance**: Ensures that the allowance is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - **Postconditions for balances**: Updates the balances for both the sender and recipient.
   - **Success Condition**: Similar to the transfer function, it allows for zero-value transfers.

4. **Approve Function**:
   - **Postcondition for `_spender`**: Ensures the spender's address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: Adjusted to handle zero-value approvals while ensuring the function returns success.

5. **BalanceOf and Allowance Functions**:
   - Simply return the balance and allowance based on the state variables, ensuring that the return values match the expected values.

### Key Considerations:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure that they reflect the expected state changes after function execution.
- Success conditions are designed to handle both successful and unsuccessful outcomes, ensuring that the contract behaves correctly according to the ERC20 standard.
- The checks for zero addresses help prevent any invalid operations that could lead to unintended consequences.

This implementation should resolve the errors reported by the verifier by ensuring that the postconditions accurately represent the contract's behavior according to the ERC20 standard.

=== USER [2025-03-13 16:36:19] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **Total Supply**:
   - The postcondition ensures that the returned supply matches the `_totalSupply` state variable.

2. **Transfer Function**:
   - **Postcondition for `_to`**: Ensures that the recipient address is not zero.
   - **Postcondition for sender's balance**: Confirms that the sender has enough balance to cover the transfer amount.
   - **Postconditions for balances**: Updates the sender's balance by subtracting `_value` and the recipient's balance by adding `_value`.
   - **Success Condition**: Allows for zero-value transfers while ensuring that the function returns success.

3. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - **Postconditions for `_from` and `_to`**: Ensures both addresses are not zero.
   - **Postcondition for sender's balance**: Confirms that the `_from` address has enough balance to cover the transfer.
   - **Postcondition for allowance**: Ensures that the allowance is sufficient to cover the transfer.
   - **Postconditions for balances**: Updates the balances for both the sender and recipient.
   - **Success Condition**: Similar to the transfer function, it allows for zero-value transfers.

4. **Approve Function**:
   - **Postcondition for `_spender`**: Ensures the spender's address is not zero.
   - **Success Condition**: Adjusted to handle zero-value approvals while ensuring the function returns success.

5. **BalanceOf and Allowance Functions**:
   - Simply return the balance and allowance based on the state variables, ensuring that the return values match the expected values.

### Key Considerations:
- The postconditions are structured to ensure that they reflect the expected state changes after function execution.
- Success conditions are designed to handle both successful and unsuccessful outcomes, ensuring that the contract behaves correctly according to the ERC20 standard.
- The checks for zero addresses help prevent any invalid operations that could lead to unintended consequences.

This implementation should resolve the errors reported by the verifier by ensuring that the postconditions accurately represent the contract's behavior according to the ERC20 standard.
