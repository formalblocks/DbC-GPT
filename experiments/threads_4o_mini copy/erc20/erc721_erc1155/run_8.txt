=== USER [2025-03-13 19:04:07] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The returned supply must equal the current total supply of tokens.
2. **transfer**: 
   - If the sender is transferring to themselves, their balance should remain the same unless the value is zero.
   - If transferring to another address, the balance of the recipient increases by the value transferred and the sender's balance decreases by the same amount.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Similar to `transfer`, but it also checks that the allowance is decremented appropriately unless the sender is the `from` address.
4. **approve**: The allowance for the spender should be set to the specified value.
5. **balanceOf**: The returned balance should equal the balance stored in the mapping.
6. **allowance**: The returned remaining allowance must equal what is stored in the mapping for the spender.

These postconditions ensure that the contract behavior adheres to the ERC20 standard, allowing for proper verification of the contract's functionality.

    */

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Changes for `transferFrom` Postconditions:
1. **Success Condition**: The postcondition now explicitly states that if the transaction is successful and `_value` is greater than 0, the success flag must be true, otherwise it can be false without affecting the balance changes.
   
2. **Balance Changes**: 
   - The condition `(msg.sender == _from ? _balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) : _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value)` checks that if the sender is the `_from` address, their balance remains unchanged; otherwise, the allowance for the sender must be decremented correctly.
   - The postcondition `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value` ensures that the recipient's balance is increased by the transferred amount.

These adjustments ensure that the postconditions hold true under all expected scenarios of the `transferFrom` function, aligning with the ERC20 standard and satisfying the verifier's requirements.

```

### Explanation of Postconditions for `transferFrom`:
1. **Success Condition**: The postcondition `(success && _value > 0) || !success` ensures that if the function is successful and `_value` is greater than 0, then the success flag must be true. If the function fails, the success flag can be false without affecting balances.

2. **Balance Changes**:
   - `_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value`: This condition ensures that the balance of the `_from` address decreases by the amount transferred.
   - `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value`: This condition ensures that the balance of the `_to` address increases by the amount transferred.

3. **Allowance Changes**: 
   - `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value`: This condition ensures that the allowance for the spender (msg.sender) is decremented by the amount transferred.

### Additional Notes:
- The conditions ensure that the state changes are consistent with the expected behavior outlined in the ERC20 standard.
- The checks for allowances and balances are crucial to maintaining the integrity of the token transfer process, especially when dealing with delegated transfers (transferFrom).
- These postconditions should now pass verification, ensuring that the function behaves as expected under all scenarios.

### Explanation of Postconditions for `transferFrom`:
1. **Success Condition**: The postcondition `(success && _value > 0) || !success` ensures that if the function is successful and `_value` is greater than 0, then the success flag must be true. If the function fails, the success flag can be false without affecting the balances.

2. **Balance Changes**:
   - `_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value || _value == 0`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the balance of the `_from` address decreases by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the balance remains unchanged.
   - `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the balance of the `_to` address increases by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the balance remains unchanged.

3. **Allowance Changes**:
   - `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the allowance for the spender (msg.sender) is decremented by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the allowance remains unchanged.

### Additional Notes:
- The conditions ensure that the state changes are consistent with the expected behavior outlined in the ERC20 standard.
- The checks for balances and allowances are crucial to maintaining the integrity of the token transfer process, especially when dealing with delegated transfers (transferFrom).
- These postconditions should now pass verification, ensuring that the function behaves as expected under all scenarios.

   - `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || (_value == 0 && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the balance of the `_to` address increases by that amount.

- These postconditions ensure that the state changes are consistent with the expected behavior outlined in the ERC20 standard.
- The checks for balances and allowances are crucial to maintaining the integrity of the token transfer process, especially when dealing with delegated transfers (transferFrom).
- With these adjustments, the postconditions should now pass verification, ensuring that the function behaves as expected under all scenarios.

To address the errors reported by the verifier for the `transferFrom` function in the ERC20 contract, we need to ensure that the postconditions are correctly formulated to reflect the expected behavior and handle all edge cases. Below is the updated contract with appropriate postconditions for each function, particularly focusing on refining the `transferFrom` function's postconditions:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions for `transferFrom`:
1. **Success Condition**: The postcondition `(success && _value > 0) || !success` ensures that if the function is successful and `_value` is greater than 0, the success flag must be true. If the function fails, the success flag can be false without affecting the balances.

2. **Balance Changes**:
   - `_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value || _value == 0`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the balance of the `_from` address decreases by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the balance remains unchanged.
   - `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the balance of the `_to` address increases by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the balance remains unchanged.

3. **Allowance Changes**:
   - `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the allowance for the spender (msg.sender) is decremented by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the allowance remains unchanged.

### Additional Notes:
- The conditions ensure that the state changes are consistent with the expected behavior outlined in the ERC20 standard.
- The checks for balances and allowances are crucial to maintaining the integrity of the token transfer process, especially when dealing with delegated transfers (transferFrom).
- These postconditions should now pass verification, ensuring that the function behaves as expected under all scenarios.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

   - The postcondition `(success && _value > 0) || !success` ensures that if the function is successful and `_value` is greater than 0, the success flag must be true. If the function fails, the success flag can be false without affecting the balances.

If `_value` is 0, the balance remains unchanged.
   - `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || (_value == 0 && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the balance of the `_to` address increases by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the balance remains unchanged.

3. **Allowance Changes**:
   - `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || (_value == 0 && _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]))`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the allowance for the spender (msg.sender) is decremented by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the allowance remains unchanged.

### Additional Notes:
- The adjustments made to the postconditions ensure that they correctly represent the expected behavior of the `transferFrom` function and handle edge cases such as transferring 0 tokens.
- These postconditions should now pass verification, ensuring that the function behaves as expected under all scenarios.

   - The postcondition `(success && _value > 0) || !success` ensures that if the function is successful and `_value` is greater than 0, then the success flag must be true. If the function fails, the success flag can be false without affecting the balances.

2. **Balance Changes**:
   - `_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value || _value == 0`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the balance of the `_from` address decreases by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the balance remains unchanged.
   - `_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value || _value == 0`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the balance of the `_to` address increases by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the balance remains unchanged.

3. **Allowance Changes**:
   - `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0`: This condition ensures that if `_value` is greater than 0, the allowance for the spender (msg.sender) is decremented by that amount. If `_value` is 0, the allowance remains unchanged.

### Additional Notes:
- The adjustments made to the postconditions ensure that they correctly represent the expected behavior of the `transferFrom` function and handle edge cases such as transferring 0 tokens.
- These postconditions should now pass verification, ensuring that the function behaves as expected under all scenarios.

If you have any further adjustments or additional requirements, feel free to let me know!
