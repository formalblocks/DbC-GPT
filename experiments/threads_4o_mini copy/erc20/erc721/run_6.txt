=== USER [2025-03-13 19:44:45] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

```solidity

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    /// @notice postcondition success ? _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value : _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender])
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The returned `supply` should equal the `_totalSupply` state variable.
2. **transfer**: 
   - When transferring to a different address (`_to != msg.sender`), the balance of the sender decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`.
   - If the transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient balance), the balances remain unchanged.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Similar to `transfer`, but it also checks that the allowance decreases by `_value` when the transfer is successful.
   - If the transfer fails, balances and allowance remain unchanged.
4. **approve**: 
   - If successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged.
5. **balanceOf**: The returned `balance` should match the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner`.
6. **allowance**: The returned `remaining` should match the allowance stored in `_allowed` for the given `_owner` and `_spender`.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC20 standard and provide a basis for formal verification.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The returned `supply` must equal the `_totalSupply` state variable.
2. **transfer**: 
   - When transferring to a different address (`_to != msg.sender`), the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`.
   - If the transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient balance), the balances remain unchanged.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - Similar to `transfer`, but it also ensures that the allowance for the sender decreases by `_value` when the transfer is successful.
   - If the transfer fails, balances and allowance remain unchanged.
4. **approve**: 
   - If successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged.
5. **balanceOf**: The returned `balance` must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the given `_owner`.
6. **allowance**: The returned `remaining` must match the allowance stored in `_allowed` for the given `_owner` and `_spender`.

These postconditions ensure that the contract's behavior aligns with the ERC20 standard and provide a basis for formal verification. The syntax has been corrected to prevent parsing errors in the annotations.

It seems that there is an issue with the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function in the ERC20 contract. To ensure it meets the requirements and avoids errors during verification, we need to refine the postcondition to accurately reflect the state changes while also considering the possibility of failure.

Here's the annotated ERC20 contract with corrected postconditions, particularly focusing on the `transferFrom` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _to != msg.sender) ? (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) : (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _from != _to) ?

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success ? _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]) + _value : _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]))
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **transferFrom Postcondition**: 
   - The postcondition for `transferFrom` was updated to ensure clarity and correctness. It checks that if the transfer is successful, the balances of both the sender and recipient are updated correctly, and the allowance is decreased accordingly. If the transfer fails, it asserts that the balances and allowance remain unchanged.
   - The condition for success is clearly articulated, separating the changes that happen when the transfer is successful and when it fails.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
- **totalSupply**: The `supply` returned must equal the `_totalSupply`.
- **transfer**: When transferring tokens to another address, the sender's balance decreases, and the recipient's balance increases by the transferred amount. If the transfer fails, balances remain unchanged.
- **transferFrom**: Similar to `transfer`, but also ensures that the allowance for the sender decreases by the transferred amount if successful. If it fails, balances and allowance remain unchanged.
- **approve**: If successful, the allowance for `_spender` is updated; if it fails, it remains unchanged.
- **balanceOf**: The `balance` returned must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner`.
- **allowance**: The `remaining` amount returned must match the allowance stored for the specified `_owner` and `_spender`.

These changes should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 contract.

   - If the transfer fails (e.g., due to insufficient balance), the balances remain unchanged.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the sender is not transferring to themselves, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, the recipient's balance increases by `_value`, and the allowance for the sender decreases by `_value`.
   - If the transfer fails, the balances and allowance remain unchanged.
4. **approve**: 
   - If successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged.
5. **balanceOf**: The `balance` returned must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner`.
6. **allowance**: The `remaining` amount returned must match the allowance stored for the specified `_owner` and `_spender`.

### Note:
- The formatting of postconditions has been carefully structured to ensure there are no syntax errors. Each line of the postcondition is split for clarity, which helps prevent issues during compilation and verification.
- The conditions are consistent with the ERC20 standard and provide a solid basis for formal verification.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **transferFrom Postcondition**: 
   - The postcondition has been structured to ensure that if the transfer is successful and the sender is not the same as the recipient, the balances and allowance are updated correctly. 
   - If the transfer fails, the balances and allowance remain unchanged. This provides a clear separation of the success and failure cases.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The `supply` returned must equal the `_totalSupply`.
2. **transfer**: 
   - When transferring tokens to another address, if successful, the sender's balance decreases, and the recipient's balance increases. If the transfer fails, balances remain unchanged.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the sender's balance decreases, the recipient's balance increases, and the allowance decreases. If it fails, all values remain unchanged.
4. **approve**: 
   - If successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged.
5. **balanceOf**: The `balance` returned must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner`.
6. **allowance**: The `remaining` amount returned must match the allowance stored for the specified `_owner` and `_spender`.

These changes should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 contract.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-03-13 19:47:13] ===
To address the verification errors related to the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions in your ERC20 contract, we need to refine the postconditions to ensure they are correct and accurately reflect the state changes under all conditions. 

Here’s the revised ERC20 contract with appropriate postconditions for each function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _to != msg.sender) ? 
    ///         (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value &&

    ///         (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) && 
    ///          _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success ? 
    ///         _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value : 
    ///         _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]))
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **approve Postcondition**: 
   - The postcondition for `approve` checks that if the function is successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged. This ensures that the allowance is correctly updated only on success.
   
2. **transferFrom Postcondition**: 
   - The postcondition checks that if the transfer is successful and `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the balances and allowance are updated. If the transfer fails, all values remain unchanged. This ensures that the state is consistently maintained across both success and failure cases.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The `supply` returned must equal the `_totalSupply`.
2. **transfer**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the sender is not transferring to themselves, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. If the transfer fails, balances remain unchanged.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, the recipient's balance increases by `_value`, and the allowance decreases by `_value`. If it fails, all values remain unchanged.
4. **approve**: 
   - If successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged.
5. **balanceOf**: The `balance` returned must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner`.
6. **allowance**: The `remaining` amount returned must match the allowance stored for the specified `_owner` and `_spender`.

These changes should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 contract.

To resolve the verification error related to the `transferFrom` function in your ERC20 contract, we need to ensure that the postcondition accurately reflects the state changes under all conditions, including success and failure scenarios.

Here’s the revised ERC20 contract with appropriate postconditions for each function, focusing on the `transferFrom` function to ensure it meets the verification requirements:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success ?

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **transferFrom Postcondition**: 
   - The postcondition checks that if the transfer is successful and `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the balances of both the sender and recipient are updated correctly, and the allowance for the sender decreases by `_value`. If the transfer fails, all values remain unchanged. This ensures that the contract state is consistent and accurately reflects the expected behavior.

2. **approve Postcondition**: 
   - The postcondition confirms that if the approval is successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to the new value. If it fails, the allowance remains unchanged.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The `supply` returned must equal the `_totalSupply`.
2. **transfer**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the sender is not transferring to themselves, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. If the transfer fails, balances remain unchanged.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, the recipient's balance increases by `_value`, and the allowance decreases by `_value`. If it fails, all values remain unchanged.
4. **approve**: 
   - If successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged.
5. **balanceOf**: The `balance` returned must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner`.
6. **allowance**: The `remaining` amount returned must match the allowance stored for the specified `_owner` and `_spender`.

By implementing these changes, the postconditions should now accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 contract and resolve the verification errors.

        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

To address the verification errors related to the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions in your ERC20 contract, we need to refine the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior under all conditions, including both success and failure scenarios. 

Here’s the annotated ERC20 contract with appropriate postconditions for each function, focusing on the identified errors:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success && _to != msg.sender) ? 
    ///         (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value && 
    ///          _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value) :

    ///          _balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]))
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition (success ? 
    ///         _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value : 
    ///         _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[msg.sender][_spender]))
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
1. **approve Postcondition**: 
   - The postcondition for `approve` checks that if the function is successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged. This ensures that the allowance is only updated on success.

2. **transferFrom Postcondition**: 
   - The postcondition checks that if the transfer is successful and `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the balances of both the sender and recipient are updated correctly, and the allowance for the sender decreases by `_value`. If the transfer fails, all values remain unchanged. This ensures that the state is consistently maintained across both success and failure cases.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The `supply` returned must equal the `_totalSupply`.
2. **transfer**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the sender is not transferring to themselves, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. If the transfer fails, balances remain unchanged.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, the recipient's balance increases by `_value`, and the allowance decreases by `_value`. If it fails, all values remain unchanged.
4. **approve**: 
   - If successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged.
5. **balanceOf**: The `balance` returned must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner`.
6. **allowance**: The `remaining` amount returned must match the allowance stored for the specified `_owner` and `_spender`.

These changes should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 contract.

=== USER [2025-03-13 19:48:55] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient

1. **totalSupply**: The `supply` returned must equal the `_totalSupply`.
2. **transfer**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the sender is not transferring to themselves, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. If the transfer fails, balances remain unchanged.

### Key Changes to Postconditions:
1. **transferFrom Postcondition**:
   - The postcondition checks that if the transfer is successful and `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the balances of both the sender and recipient are updated correctly, and the allowance for the sender decreases by `_value`. If the transfer fails, all values remain unchanged. This ensures that the state is consistently maintained across both success and failure cases.

2. **approve Postcondition**:
   - The postcondition confirms that if the approval is successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to the new value. If it fails, the allowance remains unchanged. This properly reflects the expected behavior of the `approve` function.

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **totalSupply**: The `supply` returned must equal the `_totalSupply`.
2. **transfer**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the sender is not transferring to themselves, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, and the recipient's balance increases by `_value`. If the transfer fails, balances remain unchanged.
3. **transferFrom**: 
   - If the transfer is successful and the `_from` is not equal to `_to`, the sender's balance decreases by `_value`, the recipient's balance increases by `_value`, and the allowance decreases by `_value`. If it fails, all values remain unchanged.
4. **approve**: 
   - If successful, the allowance for `_spender` is set to `_value`. If it fails, it remains unchanged.
5. **balanceOf**: The `balance` returned must match the balance stored in `_balances` for the specified `_owner`.
6. **allowance**: The `remaining` amount returned must match the allowance stored for the specified `_owner` and `_spender`.

These changes should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the ERC20 contract.
