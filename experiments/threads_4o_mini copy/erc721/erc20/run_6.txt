=== USER [2025-03-13 23:38:23] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions

1. **balanceOf**: Ensures that the balance returned matches the count of NFTs owned by the specified address.
  
2. **ownerOf**: Confirms that the owner of the token ID is returned correctly and is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: Verifies that the approved address for the token ID is updated correctly, or remains unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: Ensures that the approved address for a given token ID is returned correctly.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: Checks that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly or remains unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: Confirms that the approval status for the operator is returned correctly.

7. **transferFrom**: Validates that the ownership of the token is transferred correctly, and updates the owned tokens count for both the sender and the recipient.

8. **safeTransferFrom (overloaded)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, but additionally ensures that the token transfer adheres to the ERC-721 rules regarding contract recipients.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Same as the previous `safeTransferFrom` but allows for additional data to be sent, verifying that the token ownership is transferred correctly.

These postconditions help ensure that the functions behave as expected according to the ERC-721 standard, providing a formal specification for verification.

=== USER [2025-03-13 23:38:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: The number of NFTs owned by the `_owner` must match the value returned by `balance`.

2. **ownerOf**: The function must return the correct owner of the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, ensuring that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: The approved address for the NFT must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: The function must return the approved address for the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, or zero if there is no approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The function must return the correct approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the NFT must be transferred correctly. The counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient must be updated accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring correct ownership transfer and updates to the owned token counts.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Similar to the previous `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for the recipient's ability to accept the NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-721 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-13 23:39:38] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must equal the number of NFTs owned by the specified `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: The function must return the correct owner of the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, ensuring that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: The approved address for the NFT must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: The function must return the approved address for the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, or zero if there is no approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The function must return the correct approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the NFT must be transferred correctly. The counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient must be updated accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring correct ownership transfer and updates to the owned token counts.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Similar to the previous `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for the recipient's ability to accept the NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-721 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-13 23:40:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must equal the number of NFTs owned by the specified `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: The function must return the correct owner of the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, ensuring that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: The approved address for the NFT must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: The function must return the approved address for the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, or zero if there is no approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The function must return the correct approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the NFT must be transferred correctly. The counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient must be updated accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring correct ownership transfer and updates to the owned token counts.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Similar to the previous `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for the recipient's ability to accept the NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-721 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-13 23:41:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must equal the number of NFTs owned by the specified `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: The function must return the correct owner of the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, ensuring that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: The approved address for the NFT must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: The function must return the approved address for the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, or zero if there is no approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The function must return the correct approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the NFT must be transferred correctly. The counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient must be updated accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring correct ownership transfer and updates to the owned token counts.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Similar to the previous `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for the recipient's ability to accept the NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-721 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-13 23:42:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must match the count of NFTs owned by the specified `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: The function must return the correct owner of the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, ensuring that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: The approved address for the NFT must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: The function must return the approved address for the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, or zero if there is no approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The function must return the correct approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the NFT must be transferred correctly. The counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient must be updated accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring correct ownership transfer and updates to the owned token counts.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Similar to the previous `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for the recipient's ability to accept the NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-721 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-13 23:43:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must equal the number of NFTs owned by the specified `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: The function must return the correct owner of the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, ensuring that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: The approved address for the NFT must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: The function must return the approved address for the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, or zero if there is no approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The function must return the correct approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the NFT must be transferred correctly. The counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient must be updated accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring correct ownership transfer and updates to the owned token counts.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Similar to the previous `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for the recipient's ability to accept the NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-721 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-13 23:44:11] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must equal the number of NFTs owned by the specified `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: The function must return the correct owner of the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, ensuring that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: The approved address for the NFT must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: The function must return the approved address for the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, or zero if there is no approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The function must return the correct approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the NFT must be transferred correctly. The counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient must be updated accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring correct ownership transfer and updates to the owned token counts.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Similar to the previous `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for the recipient's ability to accept the NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-721 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-13 23:45:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must equal the number of NFTs owned by the specified `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: The function must return the correct owner of the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, ensuring that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: The approved address for the NFT must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: The function must return the approved address for the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, or zero if there is no approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The function must return the correct approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the NFT must be transferred correctly. The counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient must be updated accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring correct ownership transfer and updates to the owned token counts.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Similar to the previous `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for the recipient's ability to accept the NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-721 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.

=== USER [2025-03-13 23:46:25] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function

        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

### Explanation of Postconditions:

1. **balanceOf**: The balance returned must equal the number of NFTs owned by the specified `_owner`.

2. **ownerOf**: The function must return the correct owner of the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, ensuring that the owner is not the zero address.

3. **approve**: The approved address for the NFT must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

4. **getApproved**: The function must return the approved address for the NFT identified by `_tokenId`, or zero if there is no approved address.

5. **setApprovalForAll**: The approval status for the operator must be updated correctly, or remain unchanged if the operation fails.

6. **isApprovedForAll**: The function must return the correct approval status of the operator for the owner.

7. **transferFrom**: The ownership of the NFT must be transferred correctly. The counts of owned tokens for both the sender and the recipient must be updated accordingly.

8. **safeTransferFrom (without data)**: Similar to `transferFrom`, ensuring correct ownership transfer and updates to the owned token counts.

9. **safeTransferFrom (with data)**: Similar to the previous `safeTransferFrom`, but checks for the recipient's ability to accept the NFT.

These postconditions ensure that the contract adheres to the expected behavior specified in the ERC-721 standard and provides a basis for formal verification.
