Do not exceed this limit under any circumstances.\n            - Position: add the solc-verify annotation above the related function, example:\n                /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply\n                function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);\n            - Output format: return the annotated interface inside code fence (```) to show the code block. RETURN JUST THE CONTRACT ANNOTATED, NOTHING MORE.\n\n            Guidance for Generating Postconditions:\n\n            - State Changes: Reflect how state variables change. For example, ownership transfer should reflect changes in token ownership and balances.\n            - Conditions on Input: Consider how inputs affect the state variables.\n            - Reset Conditions: Ensure certain variables are reset after the function execution, if applicable.\n                \n            ERC interface example:\n            ```solidity\n                pragma solidity >=0.5.0;\n                \n                contract IERC721 {\n                    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[owner] == balance\n                    function balanceOf(address owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);\n                    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[tokenId] == _owner\n                    /// @notice postcondition  _owner !=  address(0)\n                    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (address owner);\n\n                    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[tokenId] == to \n                    /// @notice emits Approval\n                    function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) public;\n                    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[tokenId] != address(0)\n                    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[tokenId] == approved\n                    function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) public view returns (address operator);\n\n                    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][to] == approved\n                    /// @notice emits ApprovalForAll\n                    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool _approved) public;\n                    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[owner][operator] == approved\n                    function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) public view returns (bool);\n\n                    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_ownedTokensCount[from] ) -
