A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).\r\n\r\n                ## Abstract\r\n\r\n                This standard outlines a smart contract interface that can represent any number of fungible and non-fungible token types. Existing standards such as ERC-20 require deployment of separate contracts per token type. The ERC-721 standard\'s token ID is a single non-fungible index and the group of these non-fungibles is deployed as a single contract with settings for the entire collection. In contrast, the ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard allows for each token ID to represent a new configurable token type, which may have its own metadata, supply and other attributes.\r\n\r\n                The `_id` argument contained in each function\'s argument set indicates a specific token or token type in a transaction.\r\n\r\n                ## Motivation\r\n\r\n                Tokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each token type or collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address. With the rise of blockchain games and platforms like Enjin Coin, game developers may be creating thousands of token types, and a new type of token standard is needed to support them. However, ERC-1155 is not specific to games and many other applications can benefit from this flexibility.\r\n\r\n                New functionality is possible with this design such as transferring multiple token types at once, saving on transaction costs. Trading (escrow / atomic swaps) of multiple tokens can be built on top of this standard and it removes the need to "approve" individual token contracts separately. It is also easy to describe and mix multiple fungible or non-fungible token types in a single contract.\r\n\r\n                ## Specification\r\n\r\n                The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",

The prescribed keccak256 acceptance value magic for the receiver hook being called MUST be returned after forwarding is successful.\r\n                * The `_data` argument MAY be re-purposed for the new context.\r\n                * If forwarding fails the transaction MAY be reverted.\r\n                    -

i.e. an external viewer MUST still be able to query the balance via a standard function and it MUST be identical to the balance as determined by `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` events alone.\r\n                * If the receiver is a contract the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hooks still need to be called on it and the return values respected the same as if a standard transfer function had been called. \r\n                    - However while the `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions MUST revert if a receiving contract does not implement the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface, a non-standard function MAY proceed with the transfer.\r\n                    -

To make sure event order is correct in the case of valid re-entry (e.g. if a receiver contract forwards tokens on receipt) state balance and events balance MUST match before calling an external contract.\r\n\r\n                **_onERC1155Received rules:_**\r\n                -

It MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x01ffc9a7` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument. This signifies ERC-165 support.\r\n                - It MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x4e2312e0` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument. This signifies ERC-1155 `ERC1155TokenReceiver` support.\r\n                - It MUST NOT consume more than 10,000 gas.\r\n                    - This keeps it below the ERC-165 requirement of 30,000 gas, reduces the gas reserve needs and minimises possible side-effects of gas exhaustion during the call.\r\n\r\n                **_Implementation specific transfer API rules:_**\r\n                * If an implementation specific API function is used to transfer ERC-1155 token(s) to a contract, the `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` (as appropriate) rules MUST still be followed if the receiver implements the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface. If it does not the non-standard implementation SHOULD revert but MAY proceed.    \r\n                * An example:\r\n                    1. An approved user calls a function such as `function myTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values);`.\r\n                    2. `myTransferFrom` updates the balances for `_from` and `_to` addresses for all `_ids` and `_values`.\r\n                    3. `myTransferFrom` emits `TransferBatch` with the details of what was transferred from address `_from` to address `_to`.\r\n                    4. `myTransferFrom` checks if `_to` is a contract address and determines that it is so (if not, then the transfer can be considered successful).\r\n                    5. `myTransferFrom` calls `onERC1155BatchReceived` on `_to` and it reverts or returns an unknown value (if it had returned `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))` the transfer can be considered successful).    \r\n                    6. At this point `myTransferFrom` SHOULD revert the transaction immediately as receipt of the token(s) was not explicitly accepted by the `onERC1155BatchReceived` function.            \r\n                    7. If however `myTransferFrom` wishes to continue it MUST call `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` on `_to` and if it returns the constant value `true` the transaction MUST be reverted, as it is now known to be a valid receiver and the previous acceptance step failed. \r\n                        - NOTE: You could have called `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` at a previous step if you wanted to gather and act upon that information earlier, such as in a hybrid standards scenario.\r\n                    8. If the above call to `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` on `_to` reverts or returns a value other than the constant value `true` the `myTransferFrom` function MAY consider this transfer successful.\r\n                        - __NOTE__: this MAY result in unrecoverable tokens if sent to an address that does not expect to receive ERC-1155 tokens.\r\n                * The above example is not exhaustive but illustrates the major points (and shows that most are shared with `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`):\r\n                    - Balances that are updated MUST have equivalent transfer events emitted.\r\n                    - A receiver address has to be checked if it is a contract and if so relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook function(s) have to be called on it. \r\n                    - Balances (and events associated) that are referenced in a call to an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook MUST be updated (and emitted) before the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook is called.\r\n                    - The return values of the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook functions that are called MUST be respected if they are implemented.    \r\n                    - Only non-standard transfer functions MAY allow tokens to be sent to a recipient contract that does NOT implement the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook functions. `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` MUST revert in that case (unless it is a hybrid standards implementation see "Backwards Compatibility").\r\n\r\n                **_Minting/creating and burning/destroying rules:_**\r\n                * A mint/create operation is essentially a specialized transfer and MUST follow these rules:\r\n                    - To broadcast the existence of a token ID with no initial balance, the contract SHOULD emit the `TransferSingle` event from `0x0` to `0x0`, with the token creator as `_operator`, and a `_value` of 0.\r\n                    - The "TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules" MUST be followed as appropriate for the mint(s) (i.e. singles or batches) however the `_from` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address) to flag the transfer as a mint to contract observers.\r\n                        - __NOTE:__ This includes tokens that are given an initial balance in the contract. The balance of the contract MUST also be able to be determined by events alone meaning initial contract balances (for eg. in construction) MUST emit events to reflect those balances too.            \r\n                * A burn/destroy operation is essentially a specialized transfer and MUST follow these rules:\r\n                    - The "TransferSingle and TransferBatch event rules" MUST be followed as appropriate for the burn(s) (i.e. singles or batches) however the `_to` argument MUST be set to `0x0` (i.e. zero address) to flag the transfer as a burn to contract observers.           \r\n                    - When burning/destroying you do not have to actually transfer to `0x0` (that is impl specific), only the `_to` argument in the event MUST be set to `0x0` as above.\r\n                * The total value transferred from address `0x0` minus the total value transferred to `0x0` observed via the `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` events MAY be used by clients and exchanges to determine the "circulating supply" for a given token ID.\r\n                * As mentioned above mint/create and burn/destroy operations are specialized transfers and so will likely be accomplished with custom transfer functions rather than `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom`. If so the "Implementation specific transfer API rules" section would be appropriate.   \r\n                    - Even in a non-safe API and/or hybrid standards case the above event rules MUST still be adhered to when minting/creating or burning/destroying.\r\n                * A contract MAY skip calling the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook function(s) if the mint operation is transferring the token(s) to itself.

As such, a simple overlay method is proposed to enable localization. If the metadata JSON file contains a `localization` attribute, its content MAY be used to provide localized values for fields that need it. The `localization` attribute should be a sub-object with three attributes: `uri`, `default` and `locales`. If the string `{locale}` exists in any URI, it MUST be replaced with the chosen locale by all client software.\r\n\r\n                ##### JSON Schema\r\n\r\n                ```json\r\n                {\r\n                    "title": "Token Metadata",\r\n                    "type": "object",\r\n                    "properties": {\r\n                        "name": {\r\n                            "type": "string",\r\n                            "description": "Identifies the asset to which this token represents",\r\n                        },\r\n                        "decimals": {\r\n                            "type": "integer",\r\n                            "description": "The number of decimal places that the token amount should display - e.g. 18, means to divide the token amount by 1000000000000000000 to get its user representation."\r\n                        },\r\n                        "description": {\r\n                            "type": "string",\r\n                            "description": "Describes the asset to which this token represents"\r\n                        },\r\n                        "image": {\r\n                            "type": "string",\r\n                            "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this token represents.

To permit approval of a subset of token IDs, an interface such as [ERC-1761 Scoped Approval Interface](./eip-1761.md) is suggested.\r\n                The counterpart `isApprovedForAll` provides introspection into any status set by `setApprovalForAll`.\r\n\r\n                An owner SHOULD be assumed to always be able to operate on their own tokens regardless of approval status, so should SHOULD NOT have to call `setApprovalForAll` to approve themselves as an operator before they can operate on them.  \r\n\r\n                ## Rationale\r\n\r\n                ### Metadata Choices\r\n\r\n                The `symbol` function (found in the ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards) was not included as we do not believe this is a globally useful piece of data to identify a generic virtual item / asset and are also prone to collisions. Short-hand symbols are used in tickers and currency trading, but they aren\'t as useful outside of that space.\r\n\r\n                The `name` function (for human-readable asset names, on-chain) was removed from the standard to allow the Metadata JSON to be the definitive asset name and reduce duplication of data. This also allows localization for names, which would otherwise be prohibitively expensive if each language string was stored on-chain, not to mention bloating the standard interface. While this decision may add a small burden on implementers to host a JSON file containing metadata, we believe any serious implementation of ERC-1155 will already utilize JSON Metadata.\r\n\r\n                ### Upgrades\r\n\r\n                The requirement to emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` on balance change implies that a valid implementation of ERC-1155 redeploying to a new contract address MUST emit events from the new contract address to replicate the deprecated contract final state. It is valid to only emit a minimal number of events to reflect only the final balance and omit all the transactions that led to that state. The event emit requirement is to ensure that the current state of the contract can always be traced only through events. To alleviate the need to emit events when changing contract address, consider using the proxy pattern, such as described in [EIP-2535](./eip-2535.md). This will also have the added benefit of providing a stable contract address for users.\r\n\r\n                ### Design decision: Supporting non-batch\r\n\r\n                The standard supports `safeTransferFrom` and `onERC1155Received` functions because they are significantly cheaper for single token-type transfers, which is arguably a common use case.\r\n\r\n                ### Design decision: Safe transfers only\r\n\r\n                The standard only supports safe-style transfers, making it possible for receiver contracts to depend on `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` function to be always called at the end of a transfer.\r\n\r\n                ### Guaranteed log trace\r\n\r\n                As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, many dapps are relying on traditional databases and explorer API services to retrieve and categorize data. The ERC-1155 standard guarantees that event logs emitted by the smart contract will provide enough data to create an accurate record of all current token balances. A database or explorer may listen to events and be able to provide indexed and categorized searches of every ERC-1155 token in the contract.\r\n\r\n                ### Approval\r\n\r\n                The function `setApprovalForAll` allows an operator to manage one\'s entire set of tokens on behalf of the approver. It enables frictionless interaction with exchange and trade contracts.\r\n\r\n                Restricting approval to a certain set of token IDs, quantities or other rules MAY be done with an additional interface or an external contract. The rationale is to keep the ERC-1155 standard as generic as possible for all use-cases without imposing a specific approval scheme on implementations that may not need it. Standard token approval interfaces can be used, such as the suggested [ERC-1761 Scoped Approval Interface](./eip-1761.md) which is compatible with ERC-1155.\r\n\r\n                ## Backwards Compatibility\r\n\r\n                There have been requirements during the design discussions to have this standard be compatible with existing standards when sending to contract addresses, specifically ERC-721 at time of writing.\r\n                To cater for this scenario, there is some leeway with the revert logic should a contract not implement the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` as per "Safe Transfer Rules" section above, specifically "Scenario#3 : The receiver does not implement the necessary `ERC1155TokenReceiver` interface function(s)".\r\n\r\n                Hence in a hybrid ERC-1155 contract implementation an extra call MUST be made on the recipient contract and checked before any hook calls to `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` are made.\r\n                Order of operation MUST therefore be:\r\n                1. The implementation MUST call the function `supportsInterface(0x4e2312e0)` on the recipient contract, providing at least 10,000 gas.\r\n                2. If the function call succeeds and the return value is the constant value `true` the implementation proceeds as a regular ERC-1155 implementation, with the call(s) to the `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` hooks and rules associated.\r\n                3. If the function call fails or the return value is NOT the constant value `true` the implementation can assume the recipient contract is not an `ERC1155TokenReceiver` and follow its other standard\'s rules for transfers. \r\n                \r\n                *__Note that a pure implementation of a single standard is recommended__* rather than a hybrid solution, but an example of a hybrid ERC-1155/ERC-721 contract is linked in the references section under implementations.\r\n\r\n                An important consideration is that even if the tokens are sent with another standard\'s rules the *__ERC-1155 transfer events MUST still be emitted.__* This is so the balances can still be determined via events alone as per ERC-1155 standard rules.\r\n\r\n                ## Usage\r\n\r\n                This standard can be used to represent multiple token types for an entire domain. Both fungible and non-fungible tokens can be stored in the same smart-contract.\r\n\r\n                ### Batch Transfers\r\n\r\n                The `safeBatchTransferFrom` function allows for batch transfers of multiple token IDs and values. The design of ERC-1155 makes batch transfers possible without the need for a wrapper contract, as with existing token standards. This reduces gas costs when more than one token type is included in a batch transfer, as compared to single transfers with multiple transactions.\r\n\r\n                Another advantage of standardized batch transfers is the ability for a smart contract to respond to the batch transfer in a single operation using `onERC1155BatchReceived`.\r\n\r\n                It is RECOMMENDED that clients and wallets sort the token IDs and associated values (in ascending order) when posting a batch transfer, as some ERC-1155 implementations offer significant gas cost savings when IDs are sorted. See [Horizon Games - Multi-Token Standard](https://github.com/horizon-games/multi-token-standard) "packed balance" implementation for an example of this.\r\n\r\n                ### Batch Balance\r\n\r\n                The `balanceOfBatch` function allows clients to retrieve balances of multiple owners and token IDs with a single call.\r\n\r\n                ### Enumerating from events\r\n\r\n                In order to keep storage requirements light for contracts implementing ERC-1155, enumeration (discovering the IDs and values of tokens) must be done using event logs. It is RECOMMENDED that clients such as exchanges and blockchain explorers maintain a local database containing the token ID, Supply, and URI at the minimum. This can be built from each TransferSingle, TransferBatch, and URI event, starting from the block the smart contract was deployed until the latest block.\r\n\r\n                ERC-1155 contracts must therefore carefully emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` events in any instance where tokens are created, minted, transferred or destroyed.\r\n\r\n                ### Non-Fungible Tokens\r\n\r\n                The following strategies are examples of how you MAY mix fungible and non-fungible tokens together in the same contract. The standard does NOT mandate how an implementation must do this. \r\n\r\n                ##### Split ID bits\r\n\r\n                The top 128 bits of the uint256 `_id` parameter in any ERC-1155 function MAY represent the base token ID, while the bottom 128 bits MAY represent the index of the non-fungible to make it unique.\r\n\r\n                Non-fungible tokens can be interacted with using an index based accessor into the contract/token data set. Therefore to access a particular token set within a mixed data contract and a particular non-fungible within that set, `_id` could be passed as `<uint128: base token id><uint128: index of non-fungible>`.\r\n\r\n                To identify a non-fungible set/category as a whole (or a fungible) you COULD just pass in the base id via the `_id` argument as `<uint128: base token id><uint128: zero>`. If your implementation uses this technique this naturally means the index of a non-fungible SHOULD be 1-based.\r\n\r\n                Inside the contract code the two pieces of data needed to access the individual non-fungible can be extracted with uint128(~0) and the same mask shifted by 128.\r\n\r\n                ```solidity\r\n                uint256 baseTokenNFT = 12345 << 128;\r\n                uint128 indexNFT = 50;\r\n\r\n                uint256 baseTokenFT = 54321 << 128;\r\n\r\n                balanceOf(msg.sender, baseTokenNFT); // Get balance of the base token for non-fungible set 12345 (this MAY be used to get balance of the user for all of this token set if the implementation wishes as a convenience).\r\n                balanceOf(msg.sender, baseTokenNFT + indexNFT); // Get balance of the token at index 50 for non-fungible set 12345 (should be 1 if user owns the individual non-fungible token or 0 if they do not).\r\n                balanceOf(msg.sender, baseTokenFT); // Get balance of the fungible base token 54321.\r\n                ```\r\n\r\n                Note that 128 is an arbitrary number, an implementation MAY choose how they would like this split to occur as suitable for their use case. An observer of the contract would simply see events showing balance transfers and mints happening and MAY track the balances using that information alone.\r\n                For an observer to be able to determine type (non-fungible or fungible) from an ID alone they would have to know the split ID bits format on a implementation by implementation basis.\r\n\r\n                The [ERC-1155 Reference Implementation](https://github.com/enjin/erc-1155) is an example of the split ID bits strategy.\r\n\r\n                ##### Natural Non-Fungible tokens\r\n\r\n                Another simple way to represent non-fungibles is to allow a maximum value of 1 for each non-fungible token. This would naturally mirror the real world, where unique items have a quantity of 1 and fungible items have a quantity greater than 1.\r\n\r\n            </eip>\n'), type='text')], created_at=1717535969, incomplete_at=None, incomplete_details=None, metadata={}, object='thread.message', role='user', run_id=None, status=None, thread_id='thread_lOGeuSsckF7YiDluW2UHvvT2')], object='list', first_id='msg_U3MhNn1onvzeGKm5adHRYoHd', last_id='msg_pKn0AcFLN6fnrgoj7LMpdDtq', has_more=False)
