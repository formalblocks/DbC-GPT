Do not exceed this limit under any circumstances.\n            - Position: add the solc-verify annotation above the related function, example:\n                /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply\n                function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);\n            - Output format: return the annotated interface inside code fence (```) to show the code block. RETURN JUST THE CONTRACT ANNOTATED, NOTHING MORE.\n\n            Guidance for Generating Postconditions:\n\n            - State Changes: Reflect how state variables change. For example, ownership transfer should reflect changes in token ownership and balances.\n            - Conditions on Input: Consider how inputs affect the state variables.\n            - Reset Conditions: Ensure certain variables are reset after the function execution, if applicable.\n\n            ERC interface example:\n            ```solidity\n                pragma solidity >=0.5.0;\n                \n                contract ERC721 {\n                    \n                    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_owner] == balance\n                    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);\n                    \n                    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _owner\n                    /// @notice postcondition  _owner !=  address(0)\n                    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address owner);\n\n                    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved \n                    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;\n                    \n                    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[tokenId] != address(0)\n                    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[tokenId] == approved\n                    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);\n\n                    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved\n                    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;\n                    \n                    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved\n                    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);\n\n                    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_ownedTokensCount[_from] ) -
