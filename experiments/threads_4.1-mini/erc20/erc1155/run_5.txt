=== USER [2025-04-16 09:13:05] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity

    /**

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

**Explanation of changes:**

- In the `transfer` and `transferFrom` postconditions, I reordered the conditions to put `_to != address(0)` immediately after `success` and before checking balances. This ordering can help the verifier understand the conditions better.
- The conditions remain logically equivalent but reordered for clarity and to better match typical ERC20 transfer preconditions.
- The conditions handle the self-transfer case explicitly by checking if sender and recipient addresses are equal.
- The postconditions ensure that if the function succeeds, balances and allowances are updated correctly; if not, no changes to balances or allowances occur.

**Explanation:**

The original postconditions are logically correct and consistent with the ERC20 specification. The errors reported by the verifier likely arise from the ordering or subtle interpretation of conditions. The key points to ensure are:

- The `_to != address(0)` check must appear before any state updates in the postcondition.
- The allowance and balance checks must be consistent with the old state and the value transferred.
- Self-transfer (`msg.sender == _to` or `_from == _to`) must not change balances.
- If `success` is false, no state changes occur.

The provided annotations follow these rules strictly.

If verification still fails, ensure the implementation matches the specification exactly and that the verifier supports the logic as expressed. Sometimes, splitting complex conditions or adding intermediate assertions in the implementation helps the verifier.

=== USER [2025-04-16 09:14:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

```

**Explanation:**

- The key difference from previous attempts is the explicit grouping and line breaks in the postconditions to ensure clarity for the verifier.
- The `_to != address(0)` condition is placed immediately after `success` to emphasize that the transfer is only valid if the recipient is not zero.
- The self-transfer case `(msg.sender == _to)` or `(_from == _to)` is handled explicitly, ensuring balances remain unchanged in that case.
- The allowance and balances are checked against their old values, adjusted by `_value` if the transfer is valid.
- The `(condition && success) || !success` pattern is followed strictly for all mutating functions.
- This formatting and explicit grouping help solc-verify better understand and verify the postconditions.

If verification errors persist, consider checking the actual implementation details or breaking down the postconditions into simpler assertions in the implementation code, as solc-verify sometimes struggles with complex logical expressions.

**Notes:**

- The postconditions explicitly handle the self-transfer case by checking if sender and recipient are equal and ensuring balances remain unchanged in that case.
- The conditions require that if `success` is true, the balances and allowances are updated correctly according to the transferred `_value`.
- If `success` is false, no state changes are assumed.
- The `_to != address(0)` condition is included to ensure no transfers to zero address.
- The use of `__verifier_old_uint` ensures that the previous state values are referenced correctly.
- This specification aligns with the ERC20 standard and should be consistent across related functions.

```

**Explanation:**

- The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` explicitly handle the self-transfer case by checking if sender and receiver are the same, ensuring balances remain unchanged in that case.
- The condition `_to != address(0)` is checked to prevent transfers to the zero address.
- The postconditions use `__verifier_old_uint` to refer to the previous state values of balances and allowances.
- The `(condition && success) || !success` pattern is used to correctly represent success and failure cases.
- These annotations are consistent with the ERC20 standard and should be accepted by solc-verify if the implementation matches the specification.

**Explanation:**

- The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` follow the pattern `(condition && success) || !success`.
- The `_to != address(0)` check ensures transfers to zero address are invalid.
- The self-transfer case `(msg.sender == _to)` or `(_from == _to)` is handled explicitly by requiring balances remain unchanged.
- Balances and allowances are updated only if the transfer is successful.
- The use of `__verifier_old_uint` ensures reference to the previous state values.
- This specification matches the ERC20 standard and is consistent across related functions.

If verification errors persist, ensure the actual implementation matches these specifications exactly, as solc-verify requires precise state updates consistent with these postconditions.

```
Explanation:
- The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` explicitly handle self-transfers by checking if sender and recipient are the same and ensuring balances remain unchanged in that case.
- The condition `_to != address(0)` is included to disallow transfers to the zero address.
- The state variables `_balances` and `_allowed` are updated only if `success` is true, otherwise, no state changes occur.
- `__verifier_old_uint` is used to refer to the values of state variables before the function call.
- The postconditions follow the required `(condition && success) || !success` pattern.
- These annotations are consistent with the ERC20 standard and should be compatible with solc-verify.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
