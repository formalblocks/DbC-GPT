    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

```
Explanation of fix:
- The original error was "Expected primary expression" caused by the use of multiline expressions inside the postcondition annotation without proper formatting.
- For solc-verify annotations, multiline expressions must be split into multiple `///` lines, each line starting with `///`.
- The parentheses and logical operators are now split line-by-line with `///` at the start of each line.
- This formatting avoids parsing errors and is accepted by solc-verify.

Explanation:

- Each multiline postcondition is split into multiple lines starting with `///` to satisfy solc-verify parsing.
- Logical expressions are broken down line-by-line with clear parentheses.
- For `transfer` and `transferFrom`, special cases for self-transfers (`_to == msg.sender` or `_from == _to`) are handled explicitly.
- The postconditions reflect the expected state changes in balances and allowances per the ERC20 standard.
- View functions (`totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `allowance`) relate return values directly to the corresponding state variables.

This formatting and syntax are compatible with solc-verify and should resolve the parsing errors.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard

        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Explanation:

The previous postcondition for `transferFrom` may have been too strict or incomplete, causing the verifier to fail. To fix this:

- Added an explicit postcondition for the failure case (`!success`), stating that balances and allowances remain unchanged if the transaction fails.
- This ensures that the verifier understands the state remains consistent when `transferFrom` fails.
- This addition is consistent with the ERC20 specification that no state changes occur on failure.
- The success case remains the same, covering self-transfer and normal transfer scenarios.

This should resolve the verification error for `transferFrom`.

Explanation:

- The previous error was due to the `!success ==> ...` postcondition not being wrapped properly in parentheses.
- In solc-verify annotations, complex implications should be enclosed in parentheses.
- The fix was to wrap the entire implication expression in parentheses for the `!success` case.
- Each line of the implication is prefixed with `///` and properly indented.
- This ensures the parser can correctly interpret the postcondition.
- The postconditions remain consistent with the ERC20 standard and with each other.

Explanation:

- The error was caused by the use of `!success ==> (...)` without parentheses around the entire implication expression.
- The fix is to fully parenthesize the implication condition and each conjunct within it.
- Each line in the postcondition is prefixed with `///` and properly indented for clarity.
- This formatting is compatible with solc-verify and avoids parsing errors.
- The postconditions now correctly express that if `success` is false, the state variables remain unchanged.
- This is consistent with the ERC20 standard behavior for failed `transferFrom` calls.

=== USER [2025-04-16 03:19:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

- This syntax is compatible with solc-verify and should resolve the parsing errors.
- The added postcondition for the failure case (`!success`) states that balances and allowances remain unchanged if the function call fails, consistent with ERC20 behavior.

**Explanation:**

- The error arises because solc-verify expects the entire implication expression (`!success ==> ...`) to be enclosed in parentheses.

- Each line of the annotation is prefixed with `///` and properly indented.
- This formatting ensures correct parsing by solc-verify.
- The postconditions correctly represent the ERC20 standard behavior, including state changes on success and no state changes on failure.

**Explanation:**

- The `!success ==> (...)` postcondition is now fully enclosed in parentheses with each conjunct parenthesized, ensuring correct parsing by solc-verify.
- Each line in the annotation starts with `///` and proper indentation is used.
- This format is compatible with solc-verify's parser and should resolve the previous errors.
- The postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes and invariants per the ERC20 specification.

=== USER [2025-04-16 03:20:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation:

- The error is caused by the `!success ==> (...)` postcondition not being properly wrapped in parentheses.
- Here, the entire implication is enclosed in parentheses, and each conjunct inside is parenthesized.
- Each line of the annotation is prefixed with `///` and properly indented.
- This syntax is compatible with solc-verify and should resolve the parsing errors.
- The postconditions correctly model the expected behavior of the ERC20 functions, including state changes on success and no changes on failure.
