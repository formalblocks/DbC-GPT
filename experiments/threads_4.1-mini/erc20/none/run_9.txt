=== USER [2025-04-16 03:26:35] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

```
Explanation of fix:  
The error was caused by the use of `==>` in the annotations, which is not supported by solc-verify syntax.  
I replaced the implication `(A ==> B)` with `(A ? B : true)`, which is a valid way to express implication in solc-verify annotations.  
For example:  
`(msg.sender == _to ==> _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]))`  
was changed to:  
`(msg.sender == _to ? _balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) : true)`  
This resolves the parsing errors.

Explanation:

- For `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, the postconditions are broken down to consider 3 cases:
  1. Successful transfer with non-zero value and sender != recipient: balances and allowances update accordingly.
  2. Successful transfer with zero value: balances and allowances remain unchanged, but transfer event must still be fired (implied by ERC20 spec).
  3. Failure case: balances and allowances remain unchanged.

- For self-transfers (sender == recipient), balances remain unchanged on success.

This explicit case handling aligns with the ERC20 standard and should satisfy the verifier.

=== USER [2025-04-16 03:27:34] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation / Suggested Fixes:**

The error from the verifier indicates that the postconditions might not hold at the end of the function. This usually means the postconditions are too strict or do not cover all execution paths correctly.

In particular, for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:

- The postconditions must explicitly cover the case where the transfer is a self-transfer (`msg.sender == _to` or `_from == _to`). In that case, balances should remain unchanged on success.

- Also, the postcondition must allow for the possibility that the transfer value is zero, which must be treated as a normal transfer but does not change balances.

- The postconditions must cover both success and failure cases.

The above annotations explicitly separate these cases:

1. Success and non-zero transfer with sender != receiver: balances and allowances updated accordingly.

2. Success and zero transfer: balances and allowances unchanged.

3. Success and self-transfer: balances and allowances unchanged.

4. Failure: balances and allowances unchanged.

This should align with the ERC20 specification and satisfy the verifier.

If the implementation allows transfers where `_to` equals `msg.sender` or `_from`, these cases must be handled in the postconditions as above. If the implementation treats these differently, adjust accordingly.

If the errors persist, you may need to review the actual implementation code to ensure it matches the assumptions in the postconditions.

**Explanation:**

- The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` are split into multiple lines, each describing a distinct case explicitly:
  - Successful transfer with non-zero value and sender != recipient.
  - Successful transfer with zero value.
  - Successful self-transfer (sender == recipient).
  - Failure case.

- This explicit separation helps solc-verify to understand the different possible execution paths and verify each accordingly.

- This approach aligns with the ERC20 standard's requirement that zero-value transfers are valid and that self-transfers do not change balances.

- The previous error likely stemmed from combining these cases into a single complex condition, which made it hard for the verifier to confirm correctness.

This formatting and explicit case handling should resolve the verification errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 03:28:29] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- The postconditions are split into separate lines to clearly distinguish scenarios.
- For `transfer`:
  - When `success` is true and `_value` > 0 and sender != recipient, balances are updated accordingly.
  - When `success` is true and sender == recipient, balances remain unchanged.
  - When `success` is true and `_value` == 0, balances remain unchanged.
  - When `success` is false, balances remain unchanged.
- For `transferFrom`:
  - Similar cases as `transfer`, including allowance updates.
- This explicit splitting helps the verifier verify each case separately and avoids ambiguity.
- This addresses the verification errors by ensuring all cases are covered and consistent with the ERC20 standard.

**Explanation:**

- For `transfer` and `transferFrom`, the postconditions now explicitly cover:
  - Success with valid transfer (non-zero value and sender != receiver), balances and allowances updated accordingly.
  - Success with self-transfer (sender == receiver), balances and allowances remain unchanged.
  - Failure case, balances and allowances remain unchanged.
- Removed the zero-value transfer case as it is implicitly covered by the success cases (a zero value transfer simply does not change balances).
- This matches typical ERC20 implementations and should satisfy the verifier.
- If zero-value transfers require explicit handling, add a separate postcondition for that case, but most implementations treat them as normal transfers with no balance changes.

```

**Explanation:**

- The postconditions explicitly handle three cases for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:
  1. Successful transfer where sender and recipient are different, and balances/allowances are updated accordingly.
  2. Successful transfer where sender and recipient are the same (self-transfer), balances and allowances remain unchanged.
  3. Failure case where balances and allowances remain unchanged.
  
- This matches the ERC20 specification and covers all possible cases for these functions.

- The verifier errors typically arise when the postconditions are too strict or don't cover all execution paths, especially self-transfers.

- By explicitly stating these cases separately, the verifier can confirm correctness for each path.

- If the implementation treats zero-value transfers as normal transfers with no balance change, this is implicitly covered by the success cases above.

=== USER [2025-04-16 03:29:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Notes:**

- The postconditions cover:
  - Success cases with sender != recipient where balances and allowances are updated.
  - Success cases with self-transfers where balances and allowances remain unchanged.
  - Failure cases where balances and allowances remain unchanged.
- This matches the ERC20 behavior and should satisfy the verifier.
- If the verifier still reports errors, double-check the implementation matches these assumptions.

Explanation:

- The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` explicitly separate the cases for:
  - Success with sender/recipient different (balances and allowances updated).
  - Success with sender == recipient (balances and allowances unchanged).
  - Failure (balances and allowances unchanged).
- This avoids ambiguity and matches the ERC20 expected behavior.
- The verifier errors are likely due to not covering self-transfers explicitly.
- Ensuring these cases are properly separated should allow the verifier to prove correctness.
