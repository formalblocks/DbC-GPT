    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

```
Explanation of changes:
- Added special handling for self-transfers in `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions where `_to == msg.sender` or `_from == _to`. In those cases, balances should remain unchanged.
- For `transfer` and `transferFrom`, the postconditions now explicitly allow for `_value == 0` transfers to succeed without changing balances.
- The allowance check in `transferFrom` now includes the allowance being sufficient or zero value transfer.
- These changes ensure that the postconditions better reflect the ERC20 standard behavior and handle the verifier errors related to the previous postconditions.

```

**Explanation:**

- The key fix is to check the **old balances and allowances** for sufficiency before the transfer or transferFrom, using `__verifier_old_uint(...) >= _value` instead of `_balances[msg.sender] >= _value` or `_allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value` directly.
- This aligns with the verifier's need to reason about pre-state values and ensures the postcondition reflects the state before the function call.
- This also correctly allows zero-value transfers to succeed without requiring balance or allowance.
- The self-transfer cases are handled explicitly by comparing `_to == msg.sender` or `_from == _to`, where balances and allowances remain unchanged.
- The postconditions are consistent among related functions (transfer and transferFrom).

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

```

**Explanation:**

- The `transferFrom` postcondition error may be due to the allowance check not accounting for the case when `_value == 0`. The added postcondition line ensures that if the transfer is successful, then either the value transferred is zero or the allowance before the call was sufficient.
- The postcondition for `transfer` similarly includes the allowance check and zero-value transfer allowance.
- Self-transfer cases (`_from == _to` or `_to == msg.sender`) are explicitly handled by stating balances and allowances remain unchanged.
- This should satisfy the verifier by explicitly covering all cases required by the ERC20 standard and the verification guidelines.

Explanation:

- Added an additional postcondition to `transferFrom` to explicitly state that if the call is successful, the `_from` balance before the call must have been at least `_value`:  
  `/// @notice postcondition (success && __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value) || !success`
- This condition ensures that the verifier can confirm sufficient balance before the transfer, which was likely the cause of the previous verification failure.
- Other postconditions remain consistent with ERC20 standard and handle self-transfers and zero-value transfers appropriately.

**Explanation:**

- Added an explicit postcondition for `transferFrom` to ensure that if the function succeeds, the `_from` balance before the call was sufficient to cover `_value` (or `_value` is zero).
- This additional postcondition helps the verifier confirm the balance sufficiency condition, which was the likely cause of the error.
- The postcondition for self-transfer (`_from == _to`) correctly states that balances and allowances remain unchanged.
- The allowance check ensures that allowance before the call was sufficient or the value transferred was zero.
- This makes the specification complete and consistent with the ERC20 standard and the verification requirements.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Explanation:

- Added two additional postconditions to `transferFrom`:
  - `/// @notice postcondition (success && (_value == 0 || __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value)) || !success` ensures that the allowance was sufficient or the transfer value was zero.
  - `/// @notice postcondition (success && (_value == 0 || __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value)) || !success` ensures the `_from` balance was sufficient or the transfer value was zero.
- These explicit precondition checks for allowance and balance before the transfer help the verifier prove the main postcondition.
- The main postcondition handles self-transfer (no change) and normal transfer (balance and allowance updated correctly).
- This satisfies the verification tool's requirement to confirm preconditions for successful transfers.

**Explanation:**

- The `transferFrom` function postconditions are split into:
  - The main state update condition, handling self-transfer (no state change) and normal transfer (balances and allowances updated correctly).
  - Two additional postconditions ensure that if the call succeeds, the allowance and balance before the call were sufficient or the `_value` is zero.
- This allows the verifier to confirm that the function only succeeds if the preconditions on balances and allowances hold.
- The `transfer` function postconditions similarly handle self-transfers and normal transfers, with allowance checks.
- All postconditions use `__verifier_old_uint` to reference pre-state values, per verification guidelines.
- This should resolve the verification error related to the `transferFrom` postcondition.

**Explanation:**

- Added explicit precondition postconditions for `transferFrom` to ensure that if the function returns success, then the previous balance and allowance of `_from` were sufficient to cover the `_value`.
- These precondition postconditions (`!success || condition`) help the verifier establish that the function only succeeds when these conditions hold.
- Kept the main postcondition describing the state changes in balances and allowances, including the self-transfer case.
- This should resolve the verification error by explicitly stating the necessary preconditions for a successful transferFrom call.

=== USER [2025-04-16 03:24:04] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation:

- Added explicit precondition postconditions for `transferFrom`:
  - `!success || __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value`
  - `!success || __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) >= _value`
- These ensure that if the function returns success, then the previous balance and allowance were sufficient.
- This helps the verifier understand the necessary conditions for success, resolving the previous error.
- The main postcondition covers the balance and allowance updates for both self-transfers and normal transfers.
- The `transfer` function postconditions handle self-transfer and normal transfer cases consistently.
- All postconditions use `__verifier_old_uint` to refer to pre-state values, as required.
