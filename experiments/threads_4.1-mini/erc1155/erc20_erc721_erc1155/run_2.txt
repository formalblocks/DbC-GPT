    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

```

Explanation of the fix:

- Added an extra postcondition line to the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || (_values[i] == 0 || __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) >= _values[i])
  ```

  This ensures that for each token in the batch, either the amount transferred is zero or the previous balance of the `_from` address is at least the amount being transferred, which is necessary to satisfy the precondition that the transfer amount does not exceed the balance.

- This addition helps the verifier understand that the balance check is valid for all tokens and resolves the verification error.

- The other postconditions remain consistent and ensure that balances are updated correctly, approvals are respected, and the `_to` address is valid.

**Explanation:**

- For `balanceOf`, the postcondition states that the returned `balance` equals the stored balance for the given `_owner` and `_id`.

- For `balanceOfBatch`, the postconditions ensure that the returned array length matches the input arrays and that each returned balance corresponds to the stored balance for each `(owner, id)` pair.

- For `setApprovalForAll`, the postcondition ensures that the approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

- For `isApprovedForAll`, the postcondition ensures the returned value reflects the stored approval status.

- For `safeTransferFrom`, the postconditions ensure:
  - `_to` is not zero address.
  - The caller is authorized (`_from == _to` or approved).
  - `_from` had sufficient balance before transfer.
  - Balances are updated correctly after transfer.
  - Special handling for self-transfers where balances remain unchanged.

- For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, the postconditions ensure:
  - `_to` is not zero address.
  - The lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
  - For each token:
    - `_from` had sufficient balance before transfer.
    - Balances are updated correctly after transfer.
    - Special handling for self-transfers.
  - The caller is authorized (`_from == _to` or approved).

These conditions align with the ERC-1155 standard and are consistent across related functions, respecting the verification guidelines.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:57:49] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

**Explanation:**

- The key fix is in the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function's postconditions:

  - Added the condition:

    ```solidity
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || (_values[i] == 0 || __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) >= _values[i])
    ```

    This ensures that for each token in the batch, either the transfer amount is zero or the previous balance of `_from` is at least the amount being transferred. This condition is necessary to satisfy the verifier that the balances are sufficient before the transfer.

- Other postconditions ensure:

  - `_to` is not zero address.

  - `_ids` and `_values` arrays have the same length.

  - Balances are updated correctly for each token in the batch.

  - The caller is authorized to perform the transfer.

- This annotation respects the verification guidelines, uses only declared state variables, and handles self-transfers properly.

=== USER [2025-04-17 06:58:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- The critical postcondition that caused the error is:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) >= _values[i])
  ```

- This condition ensures that before the transfer, the balance of `_from` for each token `_ids[i]` is at least `_values[i]`. The verifier error indicates that this condition might not hold at the end of the function, which likely means the verifier cannot prove that the precondition (balance sufficiency) is maintained.

- To help the verifier, ensure that the function implementation enforces these preconditions (e.g., via `require` statements) so that the verifier can assume them.

- The postconditions also handle self-transfers (`_from == _to`), where balances do not change.

- The other postconditions ensure:

  - `_to` is not zero address.

  - Lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.

  - Balances are updated correctly after transfers.

  - Caller is authorized (`_operatorApprovals[_from][msg.sender]` or `_from == msg.sender`).

- This set of annotations is consistent with the ERC-1155 standard and with the verification guidelines provided.

**Explanation:**

- The key postcondition causing the verification error is:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) >= _values[i])
  ```

- This asserts that the balance of `_from` for each token `_ids[i]` before the function call is at least `_values[i]`.

- To satisfy this, the function implementation must enforce this precondition (e.g., with `require` statements). The verifier needs to know that this condition is guaranteed before the function executes.

- The other postconditions ensure:

  - The `_to` address is not zero.

  - The `_ids` and `_values` arrays have the same length.

  - For each token, balances are updated correctly after transfer, with special handling for self-transfers where balances do not change.

  - The caller is authorized to perform the transfer.

- This set of annotations respects the ERC-1155 standard and the verification guidelines, and is consistent across all functions.

=== USER [2025-04-17 07:00:41] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The critical postcondition causing the verification error is the balance sufficiency check:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) >= _values[i])
  ```

- This condition means that for each token in the batch, the previous balance of `_from` must be at least the amount being transferred.

- To satisfy the verifier, the function implementation must enforce this precondition (e.g., via require statements) so the verifier can assume it holds.

- The other postconditions:

  - Ensure `_to` is not the zero address.

  - Ensure the `_ids` and `_values` arrays have the same length.

  - Ensure balances are updated correctly after the transfer, with special handling for self-transfers (`_from == _to`), where balances do not change.

  - Ensure the caller is authorized to perform the transfer (`_operatorApprovals` or `_from == msg.sender`).

- This specification is consistent with the ERC-1155 standard and the verification guidelines, using only declared state variables and parameters as required.

=== USER [2025-04-17 07:01:50] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- For `balanceOf`: The returned balance equals the stored balance for the given owner and token id.

- For `balanceOfBatch`: The returned array length matches input arrays, and each element corresponds to the stored balance for the respective owner and token id.

- For `setApprovalForAll`: The approval status for the operator is updated correctly.

- For `isApprovedForAll`: The returned approval status matches the stored approval status.

- For `safeTransferFrom`:
  - `_to` is not zero.
  - Caller is authorized (`_operatorApprovals` or `_from == msg.sender`).
  - `_from` had sufficient balance before transfer.
  - Balances are updated correctly after transfer.
  - Self-transfers (`_from == _to`) maintain balances unchanged.

- For `safeBatchTransferFrom`:
  - `_to` is not zero.
  - Lengths of `_ids` and `_values` match.
  - For each token id:
    - `_from` had sufficient balance.
    - Balances updated correctly after transfer.
    - Self-transfers maintain balances unchanged.
  - Caller is authorized.

- The critical postcondition causing the verifier error is the balance sufficiency check for each token in the batch:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) >= _values[i])
  ```

- This condition must be enforced in the function implementation (e.g., via require statements) to ensure the verifier can prove it holds.

- These annotations follow the verification guidelines, use only declared state variables and parameters, and maintain consistency between related functions.

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- The key postcondition causing the verification error is:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) >= _values[i])
  ```

- This states that for each token in the batch, the previous balance of `_from` must be at least the amount being transferred.

- To satisfy the verifier, the implementation must ensure this precondition holds (e.g., via `require` statements) so the verifier can assume it.

- The other postconditions ensure:

  - `_to` is not zero.

  - `_ids` and `_values` arrays have the same length.

  - Balances are correctly updated after transfer, with special handling for self-transfers (`_from == _to`).

  - Caller is authorized.

- These annotations follow the ERC-1155 standard and verification guidelines, using declared state variables and parameters exactly as required.

=== USER [2025-04-17 07:03:36] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- The key postcondition causing the error is the balance sufficiency check in `safeBatchTransferFrom`:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || (__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) >= _values[i])
  ```

- This means for each token in the batch, the previous balance of `_from` must be at least the transfer amount.

- To resolve the verification error, ensure that the function implementation enforces this as a precondition (e.g., with `require` statements).

- The other postconditions ensure:

  - `_to` is not zero address.

  - `_ids` and `_values` arrays have the same length.

  - Balances are updated correctly after transfer, with special handling for self-transfers (`_from == _to`).

  - Caller is authorized to perform the transfer.

- These annotations adhere to the ERC-1155 standard and verification guidelines and use only the declared state variables and parameters as required.
