=== USER [2025-04-16 13:44:25] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation of key points in postconditions:

- balanceOf returns the count of tokens owned by _owner, which is _ownedTokensCount[_owner].

- ownerOf returns the owner address for the tokenId, which is _tokenOwner[_tokenId].

- approve sets the approved address for the tokenId to _approved.

- getApproved returns the approved address for the tokenId.

- setApprovalForAll sets the operator approval status for msg.sender to _approved.

- isApprovedForAll returns the approval status of _operator for _owner.

- transferFrom, safeTransferFrom functions update ownership and balances accordingly, clearing approvals on token transfer, and handle the case when _from == _to (self-transfer) by leaving state unchanged.

Note: For transfer functions, postconditions express that after successful transfer, ownership and count mappings are updated accordingly, and the token approval is cleared. If the transfer is a self-transfer (_from == _to), the state remains unchanged.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation:

- The errors were due to using __verifier_old_uint on address type variables (_tokenOwner and _tokenApprovals), which is invalid. Instead, we use __verifier_old_address for these mappings.

- For the transfer functions, the postcondition states that if the transfer is successful and _from != _to, then the token ownership is updated to _to, the ownedTokensCount of _from is decremented by 1, the ownedTokensCount of _to is incremented by 1, and the token approval is cleared (set to address(0)).

- If _from == _to (self-transfer), then the state variables remain unchanged, i.e., they equal their old values.

- For view functions, the return values correspond directly to the state variables.

- For approval functions, the postconditions state that the approval mappings are set accordingly.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]

```

**Explanation:**

- The postconditions for `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom` (both overloads) express two cases:

  1. When `_from != _to`, the token ownership is transferred to `_to`, the `_ownedTokensCount` of `_from` decreases by 1, the `_ownedTokensCount` of `_to` increases by 1, and the approval for the token is cleared (set to zero address).

  2. When `_from == _to` (self-transfer), the state variables remain unchanged, i.e., equal to their old values.

- The use of `__verifier_old_uint` for `uint256` variables and `__verifier_old_address` for address variables ensures proper reference to pre-state values.

- All view functions relate their return values directly to the corresponding state variables.

- Approval functions update the approval mappings accordingly.

This should resolve the previous verification errors related to type mismatches and ensure consistent, correct postconditions per the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:46:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Note:**  
- The multi-line postconditions are wrapped inside `/// @notice postcondition (...)` using parentheses and proper indentation to avoid parsing errors.  
- Use `__verifier_old_uint` for `uint256` state variables and `__verifier_old_address` for `address` state variables to correctly reference old values.  
- The conditions handle both successful state changes and no-op self-transfers consistently.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:47:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The postcondition for `transferFrom` explicitly states that if `_from != _to`, then the ownership of `_tokenId` is transferred to `_to`, the balances are updated accordingly, and the approval is cleared. Otherwise (self-transfer), all state variables remain unchanged.

- Similar postconditions are applied to the two `safeTransferFrom` overloads.

- The multi-line postconditions are split with each line starting with `/// @notice` and enclosed within parentheses to satisfy solc-verify syntax.

- The use of `__verifier_old_uint` and `__verifier_old_address` correctly references the old state values, avoiding type mismatch errors.

- This precise and explicit form should resolve the previous verification errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:49:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

- Added a postcondition to `transferFrom` that requires `msg.sender` to be either the owner of the token, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token:  
  `/// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)`

- This condition captures the authorization requirements for the transfer and addresses the verification error related to caller authorization.

- The other postconditions remain consistent, ensuring that ownership, balances, and approvals are updated correctly or remain unchanged on self-transfer.

- This annotation should resolve the verification errors related to ownership and caller authorization.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- Added an explicit postcondition on `transferFrom` to require that the caller (`msg.sender`) is authorized to transfer the token: either the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token. This addresses the verification error about the caller's authorization.

- The ownership and balance updates remain consistent with ERC721 semantics, including handling self-transfers (where state variables remain unchanged).

- All view functions return values consistent with the state variables.

- Approval-related functions update the approval mappings accordingly.

This annotation ensures that the transfer functions respect the required authorization checks and state updates, satisfying the ERC721 standard and resolving the verification errors.

**Explanation:**

- Added the authorization postcondition to `transferFrom`:
  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition (msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender] || _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender)
  ```
  This ensures the caller is authorized to transfer the token.

- The ownership and balance changes are captured in the other postcondition, handling both transfer and self-transfer cases.

- Other functions have postconditions relating return values to state variables or state updates consistent with the ERC721 standard.

- This addresses the verification errors related to caller authorization and state updates for `transferFrom`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:52:56] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- Added two postconditions to `transferFrom` to address the verification errors:
  
  1. The caller (`msg.sender`) must be authorized to perform the transfer, i.e., they must be the owner of the token, an approved operator for the owner, or the approved address for the specific token.
  
  2. The state changes for ownership and balances are consistent with the ERC721 standard, handling both the case of a transfer and a self-transfer (where state remains unchanged).

- The postconditions for `safeTransferFrom` (both overloads) remain consistent with the transfer semantics.

- The view functions relate their return values directly to the respective state variables.

This should satisfy the verification tool's requirements and resolve the errors reported for `transferFrom`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 13:54:28] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The authorization postcondition for `transferFrom` is split into multiple lines for clarity and syntax correctness:
  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition (
  ///     msg.sender == _tokenOwner[_tokenId] ||
  ///     _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender] ||
  ///     _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == msg.sender
  /// )
  ```
- This ensures the caller is either the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token.

- The ownership and balance state updates are handled in the other postcondition, addressing both transfer and self-transfer cases.

- This formatting avoids parsing errors and should satisfy the verifier.
