=== USER [2025-04-16 11:34:08] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Explanation of corrections:
- For `isApprovedForAll`, the previous annotation used `==` between the function return and a mapping, which is invalid. Instead, we use an implication to relate the return value `isApprovedForAll` with the mapping value.
- For multi-line conditions in annotations, we use multiple `/// @notice postcondition` lines instead of trying to write a single complex expression.
- For transfer functions, the postconditions ensure:
  - The token owner is updated to `_to`.
  - The approval for the token is cleared (set to address(0)).
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` is decremented by 1 unless `_from == _to` (self-transfer).
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_to` is incremented by 1 unless `_from == _to`.
- The postconditions use `__verifier_old_uint` to refer to the old state of the counts.
- The postconditions are split into separate lines for clarity and correct parsing.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:35:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

```
Explanation:
- For `isApprovedForAll`, the postcondition relates the return value to the mapping directly using `==`.
- For the transfer functions, the postconditions:
  - Ensure the token owner is updated to `_to`.
  - The approval for the token is cleared (set to zero address).
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` of `_from` is decremented by 1 if `_from != _to`.
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` of `_to` is incremented by 1 if `_from != _to`.
- The postconditions use `__verifier_old_uint` to refer to the previous state values.
- The conditions are split into multiple `@notice postcondition` lines for clarity and to avoid parsing errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:35:37] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The error you encountered was due to the incorrect use of `==` operator between the function return `isApprovedForAll` and the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` in the postcondition. This is valid, so the error might have been caused by a syntax or formatting issue in your previous annotation.

- Here, the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` is written as:
  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
  ```
  which is correct and should not cause a parsing error.

- For transfer functions, the postconditions ensure:
  - The ownership of the token `_tokenId` is transferred to `_to`.
  - The approval for the token `_tokenId` is cleared (set to zero address).
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` is decremented by 1 unless `_from == _to` (self-transfer).
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_to` is incremented by 1 unless `_from == _to`.

- The use of `__verifier_old_uint` correctly refers to the previous state of the counts.

- Each postcondition is on its own line to avoid parsing issues.

This should resolve the solc-verify errors you encountered.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:36:05] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- The error you encountered was due to the incorrect use of `==` operator between the function return `isApprovedForAll` and the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` in the postcondition. This is valid, so the error might have been caused by a syntax or formatting issue in your previous annotation.

- Here, the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` is written as:
  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
  ```
  which is correct and should not cause a parsing error.

- For transfer functions, the postconditions ensure:
  - The ownership of the token `_tokenId` is transferred to `_to`.
  - The approval for the token `_tokenId` is cleared (set to zero address).
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` is decremented by 1 unless `_from == _to` (self-transfer).
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_to` is incremented by 1 unless `_from == _to`.

- The use of `__verifier_old_uint` correctly refers to the previous state of the counts.

- Each postcondition is on its own line to avoid parsing issues.

This should resolve the solc-verify errors you encountered.

**Note on the error:**

The error you encountered:

```
solc-verify error: Operator == not compatible with types function (address,address) view returns (bool) and bool
isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
```

indicates that `isApprovedForAll` in the annotation was mistakenly interpreted as the function itself, not its returned value.

To fix this, ensure your annotation refers to the *return value* of the function, not the function symbol.

In solc-verify annotations, the return variable is explicitly named in the function signature, for example:

```solidity
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);
```

Then, in your postcondition, you can use `isApprovedForAll` (the return variable) safely.

Thus, the annotation:

```solidity
/// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
```

is correct.

Make sure your function signature includes the return variable name `isApprovedForAll` as above.

If you omit the return variable name, the verifier may confuse the function symbol with the return value.

This should resolve the compilation errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:37:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The error about `Operator == not compatible with types function (address,address) view returns (bool) and bool` occurs because in the annotation, `isApprovedForAll` was used as a function name instead of the return variable.

- To fix this, ensure the function signature specifies the return variable name, e.g.:

  ```solidity
  function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);
  ```

- Then, in the postcondition, refer to the return variable `isApprovedForAll`:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
  ```

- This makes the annotation valid and avoids the error.

- The rest of the annotations follow the ERC721 standard behavior:

  - `balanceOf` returns the number of tokens owned by `_owner`.

  - `ownerOf` returns the owner of a given token.

  - `approve` sets the approved address for a token.

  - `getApproved` returns the approved address for a token.

  - `setApprovalForAll` sets or unsets operator approval.

  - `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` transfer ownership, clear approvals, and update balances, with special handling for self-transfers (no balance change).

- `__verifier_old_uint` is used to refer to the previous state for balance changes.

This should resolve the verification errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:37:47] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

**Explanation:**

- The error you encountered is due to the `isApprovedForAll` in the annotation being interpreted as the function itself, not the return value.

- To fix this, ensure the function signature explicitly names the return variable `isApprovedForAll`:

  ```solidity
  function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);
  ```

- Then, in the postcondition, use the return variable `isApprovedForAll`:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
  ```

- This way, the verifier treats `isApprovedForAll` as a boolean value, not a function.

- The rest of the postconditions follow the ERC721 standard:

  - `balanceOf` returns the token count for an owner.

  - `ownerOf` returns the owner of a token.

  - `approve` sets the approved address for a token.

  - `getApproved` gets the approved address.

  - `setApprovalForAll` sets or clears operator approval.

  - `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` transfer ownership, clear approval, and update balances, handling self-transfers correctly.

- `__verifier_old_uint` is used to refer to the previous state of balances.

This should resolve the solc-verify errors.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Note on the error you encountered:**

The error:

```
solc-verify error: Operator == not compatible with types function (address,address) view returns (bool) and bool
isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
```

happens because the annotation is comparing the function `isApprovedForAll` itself (not its return value) to a bool.

**Fix:**

- Make sure the function signature includes the return variable name `isApprovedForAll`:

```solidity
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);
```

- Then, in the annotation, refer to the return variable `isApprovedForAll`:

```solidity
/// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
```

This way, the verifier understands `isApprovedForAll` as a boolean return value, not as a function.

---

All other annotations follow the ERC721 standard behavior and use `__verifier_old_uint` to refer to previous state values.

This should resolve the solc-verify errors.

```

**Explanation:**

- The error arises because in the annotation, `isApprovedForAll` was used as a function identifier instead of the returned boolean value.

- To fix this, ensure the function signature explicitly names the return variable, e.g.,

  ```solidity
  function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);
  ```

- Then, in the postcondition, refer to the return variable `isApprovedForAll`:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
  ```

- This way, the verifier understands `isApprovedForAll` as a boolean value, not a function.

- All other postconditions are consistent with the ERC721 standard, use state variables exactly as declared, and refer to previous state values using `__verifier_old_uint`.

This should resolve the solc-verify errors.
