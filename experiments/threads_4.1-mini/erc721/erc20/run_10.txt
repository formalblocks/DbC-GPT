    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```
Explanation of fixes:
- Removed invalid use of __verifier_old_uint on address typed variables (_tokenOwner).
- Correctly compared _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] to address(0) without using __verifier_old_uint.
- Used parentheses and logical operators carefully to express the postcondition that either the state was updated correctly or unchanged.
- For the view functions, related the return values directly to the corresponding state variables.
- For the boolean return function isApprovedForAll, used `(return == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator])` syntax.
- Ensured all postconditions use the exact state variable names and parameter names as specified.
```

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:45:15] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

Explanation:
- Used `__verifier_old_address` to refer to old values of address-typed state variables (_tokenOwner), which is more appropriate than `__verifier_old_uint`.
- For transfer functions, the postcondition states that either the ownership and balances have been updated correctly and approval cleared, or the state remains unchanged.
- For view functions, the return values are directly related to the corresponding state variables.
- For `isApprovedForAll`, the return value equals the mapping value.
- All state variables and parameter names are used exactly as declared.
```

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:45:44] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation:
- For `balanceOf` and `ownerOf`, the return value is directly equal to the respective mapping.
- For `approve`, the approved address for the token is set to `_approved`.
- For `getApproved`, the return value equals the approved address for the token.
- For `setApprovalForAll`, the operator approval status for the sender is set accordingly.
- For `isApprovedForAll`, the return value equals the operator approval status.
- For transfer functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`), the postcondition states either the ownership and balances are updated correctly and the approval is cleared, or the state remains unchanged.
- Used `__verifier_old_address` for old values of address-typed state variables and `__verifier_old_uint` for uint-typed state variables.
- Parentheses are used to clearly separate conditions.
- All state variables and parameter names are used exactly as declared.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:46:10] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation:

- For view functions `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, and `isApprovedForAll`, the return values reflect the current state variables.
- For state-changing functions, the postconditions describe either the successful state update or that the state remains unchanged (in case of failure).
- Used `__verifier_old_uint` for previous values of uint256 state variables.
- Used `__verifier_old_address` for previous values of address state variables.
- Ensured all conditions use the exact parameter and state variable names as declared.
- Parentheses are used to clarify the logical structure of the postconditions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:47:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Explanation:
- For view functions, the return values directly reflect the current state variables.
- For state-changing functions, the postconditions express that either the ownership and balances are updated correctly and approval cleared, or the state remains unchanged.
- Used `__verifier_old_uint` for previous uint256 state values and `__verifier_old_address` for previous address state values.
- Parentheses clarify logical grouping.
- All parameter and state variable names are exactly as declared.
- This annotation style is compatible with solc-verify.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:47:39] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation:
- For view functions, the return value matches the corresponding state variable.
- For state-changing functions, the postcondition states that either the transfer was successful and the state updated accordingly (ownership, balances, approvals), or the state remains unchanged.
- Used `__verifier_old_uint` for previous uint values, `__verifier_old_address` for previous address values.
- Parentheses clarify the logical grouping.
- Parameters and state variables are used exactly as declared.
- The postconditions are compatible with solc-verify syntax and follow the guidelines.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Explanation:
- The postconditions are written with proper multiline comments for readability.
- For view functions, the return values correspond directly to the current state variables.
- For transfer functions, postconditions state either the transfer succeeded with correct state updates or the state remains unchanged.
- Used `__verifier_old_uint` for previous uint256 values and `__verifier_old_address` for previous address values.
- Parentheses and logical operators are used to clearly express the conditions.
- All parameter and state variable names are exactly as declared.

```
Explanation:
- The postconditions are split across multiple lines for clarity and to avoid parsing errors.
- For all functions, postconditions relate the return values or state changes to the declared state variables.
- For transfer functions, the postcondition expresses that either the transfer succeeded with state updates or the state remains unchanged.
- `__verifier_old_uint` and `__verifier_old_address` are used to refer to previous state values appropriately.
- Parameter and state variable names are used exactly as declared.
- This format is compatible with solc-verify annotation parsing.
