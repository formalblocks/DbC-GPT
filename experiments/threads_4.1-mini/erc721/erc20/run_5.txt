    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```
Explanation of fixes:
- Removed parentheses around `return ==` expression in `isApprovedForAll` postcondition and replaced `return` with `(return == ...)` syntax.
- Fixed type mismatch errors by not using `__verifier_old_uint` on `address` typed variables like `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`. Instead, used `__verifier_old_address(_tokenOwner[_tokenId])` would be ideal but since only `__verifier_old_uint` is allowed per instructions, we avoid using it for addresses and rely on equality checks without old state where possible.
- Used `address(0)` literals directly for comparison.
- Ensured all postconditions use only declared state variables and parameters exactly as given.
```

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:22:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```
Explanation:
- The errors were caused by attempting to use `__verifier_old_uint` on `address` type variables (`_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`), which is invalid.
- According to the guidelines, only state variables declared as `uint` can be used with `__verifier_old_uint`.
- Therefore, for `address` type state variables, we do not use `__verifier_old_uint` and instead just compare with their current value or use old value only for `uint` type variables.
- The postconditions for `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom` reflect that after a successful transfer:
  - The owner of `_tokenId` is `_to`.
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` decreases by 1.
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_to` increases by 1.
  - The approval for `_tokenId` is reset to zero address.
- For failure cases, the state remains unchanged (owner remains old owner).
- For view functions, the return values correspond directly to the relevant state variables.
- For `isApprovedForAll`, the return value equals the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- For `approve` and `setApprovalForAll`, the mappings are updated accordingly.

This meets the requirements and should compile without the previous errors.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:23:07] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Notes on the annotations:**

- For view functions (`balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, `isApprovedForAll`), the return values directly correspond to the current state variables.
- For state-changing functions (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`), the mappings are updated accordingly.
- For transfer functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`), the postconditions reflect that:
  - The token owner is updated to `_to`.
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` decreases by 1.
  - The `_ownedTokensCount` for `_to` increases by 1.
  - The token approval for `_tokenId` is reset to the zero address.
- The postcondition uses `__verifier_old_uint` only on `uint` state variables as required.
- The postconditions allow for the possibility that the function call fails (in which case state variables remain unchanged).
- For the `isApprovedForAll` function, the return value is exactly the value in `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- The syntax `(return == ...)` is used correctly for the return value in view functions.

This should satisfy the requirements and be compatible with solc-verify.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:23:44] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- For view functions like `balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, and `isApprovedForAll`, the postconditions relate the return values directly to the corresponding state variables.
- For state-modifying functions (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`), the postconditions specify that the relevant mappings are updated to the new values.
- For transfer functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`), the postconditions specify that if the function succeeds:
  - The owner of `_tokenId` is updated to `_to`.
  - The balance of `_from` decreases by 1.
  - The balance of `_to` increases by 1.
  - The approval for `_tokenId` is reset to the zero address.
- If the function fails, the state remains unchanged.
- `__verifier_old_uint` is only used for `uint` state variables, as required.
- Address comparisons do not use `__verifier_old_uint` to avoid type mismatch errors.
- The postconditions are consistent across related functions.
- The syntax `(return == ...)` is used for return value postconditions.

This annotation should now compile without errors in solc-verify and respects all guidelines.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:24:17] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

**Explanation:**

- For view functions (`balanceOf`, `ownerOf`, `getApproved`, `isApprovedForAll`), the return value corresponds directly to the respective state variable.
- For state-changing functions (`approve`, `setApprovalForAll`), the respective mappings are updated accordingly.
- For transfer functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`), the postcondition states that either:
  - The transfer succeeded: the owner of `_tokenId` is now `_to`, the token count for `_from` decreased by 1, the token count for `_to` increased by 1, and the approval for `_tokenId` is cleared (zero address).
  - Or the transfer failed and the owner remains the same as before.
- `__verifier_old_uint` is used only on `uint` state variables (`_ownedTokensCount`).
- No `__verifier_old_uint` is used on `address` type variables to avoid type mismatch errors.
- The syntax `(return == ...)` is used correctly for return value postconditions.
- These annotations align with the ERC721 standard and the verification guidelines provided.

        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- For view functions, the return values directly correspond to the respective state variables.
- For `approve` and `setApprovalForAll`, the approval mappings are updated accordingly.
- For `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` (both overloads), the postconditions specify that either the transfer succeeded (ownership and balances updated, approval reset) or the state remains unchanged.
- `__verifier_old_uint` is used only with `uint` typed state variables (`_ownedTokensCount`).
- No use of `__verifier_old_uint` on `address` types to avoid type mismatch errors.
- The postconditions are consistent across related functions.
- The `(return == ...)` syntax is used for return values in view functions.
- This satisfies the solc-verify syntax and the ERC721 specification requirements.

```

**Explanation:**

- For `isApprovedForAll`, the postcondition uses `(return == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator])` syntax to correctly relate the return value.
- For transfer functions, the postconditions are broken into multiple lines for clarity and to avoid parsing errors.
- The use of `__verifier_old_uint` is only on `uint` state variables as per guidelines.
- No `__verifier_old_uint` is used on `address` variables to avoid type mismatches.
- The conditions cover both success (state updated) and failure (state unchanged) cases, consistent with the ERC721 standard.
- This annotation style avoids parsing errors and matches solc-verify expectations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:25:48] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation:
- Multi-line annotation syntax is used with `/// @notice` on each line to avoid parsing errors.
- The postconditions for transfer functions express that either the transfer succeeded with state updates or the state remains unchanged.
- `__verifier_old_uint` is used only for `uint` type variables.
- Address variables are compared directly without using `__verifier_old_uint` to avoid type mismatch errors.
- The return value postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` uses `(return == ...)` syntax.
- This style complies with solc-verify requirements and the ERC721 standard.

=== USER [2025-04-16 11:27:26] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```
**Explanation:**

- Multi-line postconditions are split with `/// @notice` on each line to avoid parser errors.
- The postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` uses `(return == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator])` syntax.
- For transfer functions, the postcondition states that either the transfer succeeded with updated ownership and balances and cleared approval, or the state remains unchanged.
- `__verifier_old_uint` is used only for `uint` typed state variables.
- Addresses are compared directly without using `__verifier_old_uint` to avoid type mismatch errors.
- This annotation style is compatible with solc-verify and consistent with the ERC721 standard.
