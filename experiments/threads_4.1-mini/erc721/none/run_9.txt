    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:54:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation of fixes:
- The error about `isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` was due to using the function name `isApprovedForAll` as a variable in the annotation. Changed the return variable name to `isApprovedForAll` explicitly and used it in the postcondition.
- Removed boolean expressions like `(isApprovedForAll == true) || (isApprovedForAll == false)` which are tautologies and cause type errors.
- Parentheses around the implications `(_from != _to) ==> (...)` are properly spaced and the entire expression is a valid primary expression.
- The postconditions use only declared state variables and parameters, and `__verifier_old_uint` for previous state values, consistent with the verification guidelines.

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:55:09] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation of corrections:
- The error about `isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` was due to using the function name `isApprovedForAll` in the annotation. Instead, explicitly name the return variable `isApprovedForAll` and use it in the postcondition.
- Removed tautological boolean expressions `(isApprovedForAll == true) || (isApprovedForAll == false)` as they cause type errors.
- Properly parenthesized the implications `(_from != _to) ==> (...)` and `(_from == _to) ==> (...)` to be valid expressions.
- All postconditions use only the declared state variables and function parameters, referencing old state values with `__verifier_old_uint`.
- The postconditions are consistent across related functions like `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:55:40] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation:

- The main issue causing the errors was the use of the function name `isApprovedForAll` as a variable in the postcondition, which is a function type, not a boolean. To fix this, the return variable name `isApprovedForAll` is explicitly declared in the function signature and used in the postcondition.
- Removed tautological boolean expressions like `(isApprovedForAll == true) || (isApprovedForAll == false)` which cause type errors.
- Ensured that implications `(_from != _to) ==> (...)` and `(_from == _to) ==> (...)` are properly parenthesized and valid expressions.
- All postconditions use only declared state variables and function parameters, with previous state values referenced via `__verifier_old_uint`.
- The postconditions are consistent across related functions such as `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:56:14] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Notes on the annotations:**

- For `balanceOf`, the postcondition states that the returned balance equals the `_ownedTokensCount` for the given `_owner`, and `_owner` must not be the zero address.
- For `ownerOf`, the postcondition states that the returned owner is the `_tokenOwner` of the given `_tokenId`, and `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` is not the zero address.
- For `approve`, the postcondition states that the approved address for the `_tokenId` is updated to `_approved`.
- For `getApproved`, the return value equals the `_tokenApprovals` for the `_tokenId`.
- For `setApprovalForAll`, the approval status for the operator is updated to `_approved`.
- For `isApprovedForAll`, the return value equals the approval status in `_operatorApprovals`.
- For `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` (both overloads), the postconditions ensure:
  - The `_tokenOwner` of `_tokenId` is updated to `_to`.
  - The approval for `_tokenId` is cleared (set to zero address).
  - If `_from` and `_to` are different, `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` decreases by 1 and for `_to` increases by 1.
  - If `_from` and `_to` are the same, the balances remain unchanged.

These postconditions follow the ERC721 standard semantics and are consistent across related functions.

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:56:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The error `Operator == not compatible with types function (address,address) view returns (bool) and bool` occurs because the function name `isApprovedForAll` was used as a variable in the postcondition, which is invalid. To fix this, explicitly name the return variable in the function signature and use it in the postcondition.
- Removed tautological expressions like `(isApprovedForAll == true) || (isApprovedForAll == false)` which are unnecessary and cause errors.
- Correctly parenthesized the implications `(_from != _to) ==> (...)` and `(_from == _to) ==> (...)` to ensure they are valid expressions.
- All postconditions reference only the declared state variables and parameters, using `__verifier_old_uint` for previous state values.
- The postconditions are consistent across related functions, particularly for transfer operations.

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:57:16] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```
**Explanation:**

- The annotation for `isApprovedForAll` explicitly names the return variable `isApprovedForAll` to avoid confusion with the function name.
- Removed tautological expressions that caused errors.
- The implications use proper syntax and parentheses to be valid.
- All postconditions use only the declared state variables and parameters, and previous state values are referenced using `__verifier_old_uint`.
- Transfer functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`) have consistent postconditions to reflect the ownership and balances changes correctly, including special handling for self-transfers (`_from == _to`).

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:57:51] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```

**Explanation:**

- For `isApprovedForAll`, explicitly name the return variable `isApprovedForAll` and use it in the postcondition to avoid type errors.
- Avoid tautological expressions like `(isApprovedForAll == true) || (isApprovedForAll == false)`.
- Use proper syntax for implications `(_from != _to) ==> (...)` and `(_from == _to) ==> (...)`.
- Use only declared state variables and parameters, with previous state values referenced by `__verifier_old_uint`.
- Ensure postconditions for transfer functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`) correctly reflect ownership and balance updates, with special handling for self-transfers where `_from == _to`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 10:58:31] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

```
**Key points:**

- For `isApprovedForAll`, explicitly name the return variable `isApprovedForAll` and use it in the postcondition to avoid type conflicts.
- Avoid tautological expressions.
- Use proper parentheses and syntax for implications.
- Use only declared state variables and parameters, referencing previous state with `__verifier_old_uint`.
- Transfer functions handle self-transfers correctly by checking if `_from == _to` and adjusting balances accordingly.
