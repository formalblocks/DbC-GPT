=== USER [2025-04-16 14:16:37] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Explanation of the key fix:

- The error was caused by the annotation line for `isApprovedForAll`:
  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
  ```
  Here, `isApprovedForAll` is the function name, not the return variable. The return variable is named `bool` but unnamed in the interface. To fix this, the postcondition should refer to the return variable, which can be named `isApprovedForAll` by adding it to the function signature or use the function call syntax.

Since the interface function is declared as:
```solidity
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
```
The returned value can be named explicitly to use in the postcondition:
```solidity
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);
```
Then the postcondition can refer to `isApprovedForAll`.

If you cannot change the signature, use the function call syntax in the postcondition:

```solidity
/// @notice postcondition (result == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator])
```
But solc-verify expects the name of the return variable.

Hence, the recommended fix is:

- Change the function declaration to explicitly name the return variable:

```solidity
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);
```

- Then the postcondition:

```solidity
/// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
```

This resolves the type mismatch error.

**Explanation:**

- The error was caused because the `isApprovedForAll` function did not name its return variable, and the postcondition tried to use the function name as a variable, causing a type mismatch.
- The fix is to explicitly name the return variable in the function signature as `isApprovedForAll`.
- Then the postcondition can correctly refer to this return variable: `isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- This resolves the operator type mismatch error in the annotation.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:20:24] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The error in previous attempts was due to the postcondition on `isApprovedForAll` incorrectly comparing the function itself to a boolean state variable.
- The fix is to explicitly name the return variable in the function signature for `isApprovedForAll` as `isApprovedForAll`.
- This allows the postcondition to correctly compare the returned value `isApprovedForAll` to the state variable `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- All other functions have postconditions consistent with the ERC721 standard and use only the declared state variables.
- The postconditions for `transferFrom` and both `safeTransferFrom` functions handle the case of self-transfer (`_from == _to`) by not changing balances, and otherwise ensure balances are updated correctly and ownership transferred.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- The key fix is to explicitly name the return variable in the `isApprovedForAll` function signature as `isApprovedForAll`, so the postcondition can correctly refer to it.
- This resolves the type mismatch error where the function itself was being compared to a boolean.
- All postconditions use only the declared state variables as required.
- For `transferFrom` and both `safeTransferFrom` functions, the postconditions handle the case where `_from == _to` (self-transfer) by not changing balances, and otherwise ensure balances are updated correctly and ownership is transferred.
- View functions relate return values directly to the corresponding state variables.
- The `approve` function postcondition ensures the approval state is updated correctly.
- The `setApprovalForAll` postcondition ensures the operator approval mapping is updated correctly.

**Explanation:**

- The key fix is to explicitly name the return variable in the `isApprovedForAll` function signature as `isApprovedForAll`, so the postcondition can correctly refer to it.
- This resolves the type mismatch error where the function itself was being compared to a boolean.
- All postconditions use only the declared state variables as required.
- For `transferFrom` and both `safeTransferFrom` functions, the postconditions handle the case where `_from == _to` (self-transfer) by not changing balances, and otherwise ensure balances are updated correctly and ownership is transferred.
- View functions relate return values directly to the corresponding state variables.
- The `approve` function postcondition ensures the approval state is updated correctly.
- The `setApprovalForAll` postcondition ensures the operator approval mapping is updated correctly.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The error is due to the annotation for `isApprovedForAll` comparing the function name to a bool, which is invalid.
- The fix is to explicitly name the return variable in the function signature as `isApprovedForAll` so that it can be referenced in the postcondition.
- The postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` now correctly states that the returned value equals the state variable `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- Other functions have postconditions consistent with ERC721 standard behavior, correctly describing state changes.
- Transfer functions handle self-transfer cases correctly, where balances do not change.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:23:35] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- The main issue causing the error is the annotation on `isApprovedForAll` where the function name `isApprovedForAll` is compared to a `bool` state variable, which is a type mismatch.
- To fix this, explicitly name the return variable in the function signature as `isApprovedForAll` so it can be referenced in the postcondition.
- The postcondition now correctly states that the returned value `isApprovedForAll` equals the state variable `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- All other postconditions are consistent with the ERC721 standard, represent the expected state changes, and use only declared state variables.
- Transfer functions handle the special case where `_from == _to` (self-transfer) by not changing balances.

=== USER [2025-04-16 14:25:21] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The error is caused by the annotation on `isApprovedForAll` where the function name is compared directly to a bool, which is invalid.
- The fix is to explicitly name the return variable in the function signature as `isApprovedForAll`.
- This allows the postcondition to correctly compare the returned value `isApprovedForAll` to the state variable `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- All other postconditions are consistent with the ERC721 standard and use only the declared state variables.
- Transfer functions handle the self-transfer case (_from == _to) by not changing balances.
