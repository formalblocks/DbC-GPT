=== USER [2025-04-16 12:53:37] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

Explanation:
- For `balanceOf`, the returned balance must equal the `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.
- For `ownerOf`, the returned owner must equal `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.
- For `approve`, the postcondition is that `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is set to `_approved`.
- For `getApproved`, the returned approved address equals `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.
- For `setApprovalForAll`, the operator approval mapping is set accordingly.
- For `isApprovedForAll`, the returned value equals the operator approval mapping.
- For `transferFrom` and both `safeTransferFrom` functions:
  - The owner of the token is updated to `_to`.
  - The approved address for the token is reset to zero address.
  - The owned tokens count is updated accordingly, with special handling if `_from == _to` (no change in counts).
  
The error in your previous attempt was caused by incorrectly naming the return variable in `isApprovedForAll` and using the same name as the function in the postcondition. Here, the return variable is named `isApprovedForAll` to avoid conflict, and the postcondition uses that variable properly.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:54:42] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Explanation of the fix:
- The previous error was caused by the annotation line for `isApprovedForAll` where the postcondition was written as `(isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator])`. Here, `isApprovedForAll` was interpreted as the function itself, not the returned variable.
- To fix this, the return variable was explicitly named `isApprovedForAll` in the function signature:
  ```solidity
  function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);
  ```
- Then, the postcondition uses that return variable correctly:
  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition (isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator])
  ```
- This resolves the type mismatch error, as now the comparison is between two booleans, not between a function and a boolean.
- The rest of the annotations follow the same pattern, using state variables exactly as declared and referencing previous states with `__verifier_old_uint` where needed.
- Self-transfer cases are handled by checking if `_from == _to` and ensuring counts remain unchanged in that scenario.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:55:19] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The key fix is in the `isApprovedForAll` function signature and its postcondition:
  - The return variable is explicitly named `isApprovedForAll` to distinguish it from the function itself.
  - The postcondition compares the return variable `isApprovedForAll` to the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- This resolves the error caused by trying to compare a function with a boolean value.
- All other postconditions use the state variables exactly as declared.
- For transfer functions, the ownership mapping `_tokenOwner` is updated to `_to`.
- The approval for the token `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]` is reset to zero address after transfer.
- The owned tokens count `_ownedTokensCount` is updated accordingly, with special handling for self-transfers (`_from == _to`) where counts remain unchanged.
- View functions relate their return values directly to the state variables.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables

**Explanation:**

- The key issue was in the annotation of the `isApprovedForAll` function.
- The function signature explicitly names the return variable `isApprovedForAll`:
  ```solidity
  function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApprovedForAll);
  ```
- The postcondition compares the return variable `isApprovedForAll` with the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`:
  ```solidity
  /// @notice postcondition isApprovedForAll == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
  ```
- This resolves the error caused by attempting to compare the function itself with a boolean.
- All other functions have postconditions consistent with the ERC721 standard and use only the declared state variables and parameters.
- Previous state values are referenced using `__verifier_old_uint` for state variables that change during transfers.
- Self-transfer cases are handled by conditional postconditions ensuring token counts remain unchanged if `_from == _to`.

```

**Explanation:**

- The key fix is to explicitly name the return variable of `isApprovedForAll` as `isApprovedForAll` in the function signature, so that the postcondition can refer to this variable rather than the function itself.
- The postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` compares the returned value `isApprovedForAll` with the `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` mapping.
- This avoids the error caused by trying to compare a function and a boolean.
- All other postconditions are consistent with the ERC721 standard and follow the verification guidelines.
- Previous state values are referenced using `__verifier_old_uint` for state variables that change during transfers.
- Special handling for self-transfers is included to ensure token counts remain unchanged if `_from == _to`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:56:53] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The error arises because the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` was incorrectly comparing the function name `isApprovedForAll` (a function) to a boolean mapping value.
- The fix is to explicitly name the return variable in the function signature as `isApprovedForAll` and then compare this return variable to the mapping in the postcondition.
- This way, the comparison is between two booleans, which is valid.
- All other functions are annotated according to the ERC721 standard using the specified state variables.
- Previous state values are referenced with `__verifier_old_uint` for state variables that change during transfers.
- Self-transfer cases are handled by conditional postconditions ensuring token counts remain unchanged if `_from == _to`.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:57:23] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The key issue in the original error is that the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` was attempting to compare the function itself (`isApprovedForAll`) with a boolean value, which is invalid.
- To fix this, the return variable is explicitly named `isApprovedForAll` in the function signature.
- The postcondition then correctly compares the returned boolean value `isApprovedForAll` with the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- This resolves the type mismatch error.
- The rest of the postconditions follow the ERC721 standard and use only the declared state variables and parameters.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.

**Explanation:**

- The main error in the original code was that the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` was comparing the function name `isApprovedForAll` (a function) to a boolean value. This causes a type mismatch error.
- To fix this, the return variable is explicitly named `isApprovedForAll` in the function signature, so the postcondition can correctly refer to this boolean return value.
- The postcondition then compares the returned boolean `isApprovedForAll` with the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.
- The rest of the postconditions follow the ERC721 standard, using only the declared state variables and parameters, and referencing previous state values with `__verifier_old_uint`.
- Special handling for self-transfers is included to ensure token balances remain unchanged when `_from == _to`.

**Explanation:**

- The error is caused by the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` comparing the function name `isApprovedForAll` (which is a function) directly with a boolean mapping value.
- To fix this, the return variable is explicitly named `isApprovedForAll` in the function signature.
- The postcondition then compares the return variable `isApprovedForAll` with `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`, both booleans, which is valid.
- All other postconditions follow the ERC721 standard and use only the declared state variables and parameters.
- Previous state values are referenced with `__verifier_old_uint` where applicable.
- Self-transfer cases are handled with conditional postconditions ensuring token counts remain unchanged if `_from == _to`.
