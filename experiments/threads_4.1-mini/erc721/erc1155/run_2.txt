=== USER [2025-04-16 12:22:00] ===

    
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

Explanation of fixes:
- The errors were mainly caused by using __verifier_old_uint on address typed variables (_tokenOwner[_tokenId]) which is invalid.
- Instead, for address variables, use __verifier_old_address if available or avoid __verifier_old_uint for address.
- Since solc-verify does not support __verifier_old_address, here we omit old value comparison for address variables and only keep old value comparisons for uint256 variables (_ownedTokensCount).
- The postcondition for transfer functions now states that either the transfer succeeded (ownership updated, counts updated, approval cleared) or the state is unchanged (ownership and counts unchanged).
- The postcondition for isApprovedForAll uses direct equality.
- The postconditions only use the declared state variables and parameter names exactly as provided.
```

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:23:13] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Notes on the annotations:**

- For address type state variables such as `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`, the previous value is referenced using `__verifier_old_address` (assuming solc-verify supports this; if not, this is the correct conceptual usage to avoid type mismatch errors).

- For `uint256` type state variables such as `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` and `_ownedTokensCount[_to]`, previous values are referenced using `__verifier_old_uint`.

- The transfer functions' postconditions express that either the transfer succeeded (ownership and balances updated accordingly, approval cleared) or the state remains unchanged.

- The `isApprovedForAll` function's postcondition directly relates the return value to the corresponding mapping state.

- All postconditions strictly use the declared state variables and parameters as required.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:23:45] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The error `Operator == not compatible with types function (address,address) view returns (bool) and bool` for `isApprovedForAll` is due to using the function name `isApprovedForAll` on the left side instead of the return value variable. The postcondition uses the return variable `isApprovedForAll` (or `approved` or similar), which is the return value, not the function itself.

- To fix this, the postcondition must use the return variable name exactly as in the function signature. Since the function signature uses `returns (bool)`, without a named return parameter, we can assume the return variable is `isApproved`.

- However, in interfaces, the return variable is usually unnamed, so for solc-verify annotations, we can use the function name as the return variable name for clarity, or rename it explicitly:

  ```solidity
  function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool isApproved);
  /// @notice postcondition isApproved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]
  ```

- For address type state variables, `__verifier_old_address` is used to refer to the old value of an address variable to avoid type mismatch errors.

- For `uint256` variables, use `__verifier_old_uint`.

- The transfer functions' postconditions express that either the transfer succeeded (ownership and balances updated, approval cleared) or the state remains unchanged.

- The postconditions strictly use the declared state variables and parameters as required.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:24:18] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- For `isApprovedForAll`, the postcondition uses the return variable name `isApproved` (matching the function signature's return variable) to avoid the type mismatch error caused by using the function name.

- For address state variables like `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`, `__verifier_old_address` is used to refer to the old value, avoiding invalid type conversion errors.

- For `uint256` state variables like `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` and `_ownedTokensCount[_to]`, `__verifier_old_uint` is used.

- The transfer functions' postconditions express that either the transfer succeeded (ownership and balances updated, approval reset) or the state remains unchanged.

- All postconditions strictly use the declared state variables and parameter names as required.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- For `isApprovedForAll`, the postcondition is written to relate the returned boolean `isApprovedForAll` to the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` with an implication on both true and false cases, avoiding the error caused by comparing the function name to a bool.

- For `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom` (both overloads), the postcondition states that either the transfer succeeded with updated ownership and balances and cleared approval, or the state remains unchanged.

- `__verifier_old_uint` is used for previous values of `uint256` variables.

- `__verifier_old_address` is used for previous values of address variables.

- All postconditions use only the declared state variables and parameters exactly as specified.

**Explanation:**

- The error `Expected primary expression` was due to incorrect use of logical operators and parentheses in the annotation. The corrected version uses a simple equality comparison between the returned value `isApprovedForAll` and the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

- The `isApprovedForAll` function now returns a named variable `isApprovedForAll`, which is used in the postcondition.

- For transfer functions, the postconditions specify that either the transfer succeeded with updated ownership and counts and cleared approval, or the state remained unchanged.

- `__verifier_old_uint` is used for previous values of `uint256` state variables.

- `__verifier_old_address` is used for previous values of address state variables.

- All postconditions use only the declared state variables and parameters exactly as specified.

=== USER [2025-04-16 12:25:59] ===

        
    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)
        
    Your task is to annotate this contract with proper solc-verify postconditions:

**Explanation:**

- The error was caused by comparing the function name `isApprovedForAll` to a boolean in the postcondition. To fix this, the function's return value is named `isApproved` in the signature and used in the postcondition.

- The postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` now correctly relates the return value `isApproved` to the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

- Transfer functions (`transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`) have postconditions stating that either the transfer succeeded with updated ownership, balances, and cleared approval, or the state is unchanged.

- `__verifier_old_uint` is used for previous values of `uint256` variables.

- `__verifier_old_address` is used for previous values of address variables.

- All postconditions use only the declared state variables and parameters exactly as specified.

    Task:
        - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal verification conditions for each function.
        - Read the ERC documentation to understand the contract's behavior.
        - For each function, add postconditions by replacing "$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE" with one or more appropriate postconditions.
        - Use the solc-verify syntax: /// @notice postcondition [condition]
        
    Requirements:
        - Each function must have appropriate postconditions
        - Conditions must correctly represent the expected behavior per the ERC standard
        - Conditions for all functions must be consistent with each other
        - Annotate with postconditions above each function
        
    Verification Guidelines:
        - Use ONLY state variables exactly as declared in the contract (_balances, _allowed, _totalSupply)
        - Use ONLY parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures (_to, _from, _value, etc.)
        - DO NOT create short variable names like 'bal', 't', 's', 'u', 'v', or 'rem'
        - For referencing previous state values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)
        - For functions that return success, handle both success and failure cases: (condition && success) || !success
        - For self-transfers, add special handling when sender == recipient
        - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables
        - Ensure consistency between related functions (e.g., transfer and transferFrom)

**Explanation:**

- The error `Undeclared identifier` for `isApproved` was due to the return variable not being declared in the function signature. The function signature has been updated to name the return variable `isApprovedForAll`, and the postcondition uses the same name.

- The postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` relates the returned boolean to the `_operatorApprovals` mapping directly, avoiding comparing the function name to a boolean.

- For transfer functions, the postconditions state that either the transfer succeeded with updated ownership, balances, and cleared approval, or the state remains unchanged.

- `__verifier_old_uint` is used for previous values of `uint256` state variables, and `__verifier_old_address` for address state variables.

- All postconditions strictly use the declared state variables and parameter names exactly as specified.

**Explanation:**

- The error `Operator == not compatible with types function (address,address) view returns (bool) and bool` is caused by comparing the function name `isApprovedForAll` directly with a boolean in the postcondition.

- To fix this, the function's return variable is named `isApproved` in the signature, and the postcondition compares `isApproved` with the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

- The postconditions for transfer functions specify the state changes expected after a successful transfer or that the state remains unchanged if the transfer fails.

- `__verifier_old_uint` and `__verifier_old_address` are used appropriately for previous states of `uint256` and `address` variables.

- All postconditions use only declared state variables and parameters exactly as specified, following the guidelines.
