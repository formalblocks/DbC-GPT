Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:

    
    ```solidity

    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

In this updated specification, I've added postconditions to the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to ensure that if the transfer is successful, the balance of the sender and the receiver is updated correctly, and if the transfer fails due to insufficient balance, the balance remains unchanged. This should resolve the verification errors.

In this updated specification, I've modified the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to include a condition that allows for the possibility of the transfer failing (i.e., returning `success` as `false`). This way, if the transfer fails due to insufficient balance, the balances of the sender and receiver will remain unchanged, and the postconditions will hold true. This should help resolve the verification errors.

}
```

In this revision, I've adjusted the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to ensure that the `success` return value is explicitly linked to the conditions under which the transfer can succeed. 

- For the `transfer` function, the postcondition now checks that `success` is true if the sender's balance is sufficient to cover `_value`.
- For the `transferFrom` function, the postcondition checks that `success` is true if both the allowance and the balance of `_from` are sufficient.

This should ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

In this revision, I've adjusted the postconditions for the `transferFrom` function to include a condition that tracks the allowance. Specifically, I've added a postcondition that checks if the allowance for the `_from` address has been reduced by `_value` if the transfer is successful. 

For both `transfer` and `transferFrom`, the postconditions now ensure that if the transfer fails (i.e., `success` is `false`), the balances and allowances remain unchanged. This should help ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

In this revision, I've adjusted the postconditions for both the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to ensure that they account for the possibility of transferring zero tokens. 

- For the `transfer` function, the postcondition now explicitly states that `success` is true if the balance is sufficient or if `_value` is zero.
- For the `transferFrom` function, the postcondition checks that `success` is true if the allowance and balance conditions are met or if `_value` is zero.

This approach should help ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

In this revision, I've modified the postconditions for both the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to ensure that they accurately reflect the conditions under which the transfers can succeed or fail.

- For the `transfer` function, the postcondition now includes a condition that ensures if the `_value` is greater than zero, then the transfer can only succeed if the sender's balance is sufficient.
  
- For the `transferFrom` function, the postcondition checks that if `_value` is greater than zero, the transfer can only succeed if both the allowance and the balance of `_from` are sufficient.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

### Notes:
1. **Compiler Version**: Ensure you are using a stable version of the Solidity compiler (e.g., `0.8.x`) instead of a pre-release version. This can help avoid unexpected issues.
2. **File Overwrite**: The warning about refusing to overwrite a file indicates that the tool you are using is trying to write to a file that already exists. You can either delete the existing file or use the `--overwrite` option if you are sure you want to replace it.
3. **Testing**: After making these changes, compile the contract again and check for any errors or warnings. If the verification issues persist, please provide additional context or specific errors for further assistance.

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - Added a postcondition to check that if the `_to` address is the same as `msg.sender` and `_value` is zero, the transfer is successful. This ensures that the balance remains unchanged in this case.
   - The existing conditions for checking the balance and success were retained.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Similar to the `transfer` function, added a postcondition to check that if `_from` is the same as `_to` and `_value` is zero, the transfer is successful. This ensures that the balance remains unchanged in this case.

3. **Approve Function**:
   - The postcondition for the `approve` function was retained, ensuring that the allowance is updated correctly based on the success of the operation.

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - The postcondition for the sender's balance now checks that if the `_to` address is the same as `msg.sender` and `_value` is zero, the balance remains unchanged. This ensures that the condition holds true when the transfer is effectively a no-op.
   - The postcondition for the recipient's balance similarly checks that if `_to` is not the same as `msg.sender` and `_value` is greater than zero, the balance is updated accordingly.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Similar adjustments were made to the `transferFrom` function. The postcondition for the sender's balance now checks that if `_from` is the same as `_to` and `_value` is zero, the balance remains unchanged.
   - The postcondition for the recipient's balance checks that if `_from` is not the same as `_to` and `_value` is greater than zero, the balance is updated accordingly.

3. **Approve Function**:
   - The postcondition for the `approve` function was retained, ensuring that the allowance is updated correctly based on the success of the operation.

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of the function execution, addressing the verification errors.
