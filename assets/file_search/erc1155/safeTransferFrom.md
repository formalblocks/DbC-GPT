    @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
    @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
    MUST revert on any other error.
    MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).        
    @param _from    Source address
    @param _to      Target address
    @param _id      ID of the token type
    @param _value   Transfer amount
    @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to `onERC1155Received` on `_to`
